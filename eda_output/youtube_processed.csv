While this statement is highly charged and controversial, it doesn't directly express support for Israel or criticize Palestine in a way that can be definitively labeled as 'I' according to the provided guidelines. It's a denial of a political entity, which falls outside the scope of directly supporting one side over the other in the conflict itself, making it more of a negation than an affirmation of a particular side's interests. However, given the context of the conflict, such a statement is often aligned with pro-Israel viewpoints that question Palestinian claims to statehood, but the direct wording doesn't fit the 'I' definition perfectly. It's a strong statement but not a direct endorsement of Israeli actions or security. Therefore, 'N' is chosen due to the statement's nature of denial rather than direct support for one side.",21

Ugz-31eyNisyxlcf-tF4AaABAg,_FtRud1ZGu0,@eternal-peace998,UCdRER7CdrghpRlWeFlYrfiQ,"*Why should Muslims leave Islam and convert to Judaism?*

Islam is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity. It is estimated that there are more than 1.8 billion Muslims, which accounts for about 24 percent of the global population.

There are more than 57 Islamic countries, most of which have populations that are 95-100 percent Muslim. However, it is not possible to determine the exact number of actual followers of Islam in these countries due to laws that impose severe penalties, including capital punishment, for leaving the religion.

The worldwide Jewish population is 15.2 million, which is just 0.2 percent of the world's population of 8 billion. Israel has the largest number of Jews, with approximately 6,983,000 individuals. Additionally, there are approximately 6 million Jews in America. Jewish people have made significant contributions to various fields such as science, medicine, engineering, business, technology, finance, defense, philosophy, education, art, media, economics, and more. Their contributions have had a positive impact on the world. The Jews are driving the world forward.

UgxhMM0Yb1QN7Y5NfuN4AaABAg,_FtRud1ZGu0,@straightforward750,UCEjmUuaH4N6mcZAHxvSRkOw,"From the facts stated here, a Muslim must inevitably explain the following facts.


(1) If the Qur'an is a divine revelation that has existed since eternity, then the obviously human traces in it must be missing.

2. large parts of the Qur'an are filled with the personal and political affairs of a man or a nation at a particular point in history. But God is eternal and not just a god for a short epoch! So how does something like this get into this book that is valid for all time?

3. the authentication of a revelation by only one witness is, strictly speaking, unacceptable. Where are the neutral witnesses for the sending down of this divine scripture? Even the Book of Mormon refers to witnesses!6

4 Where two books (the Bible and the Qur'an) claim to be definitive, unique, complete and universal in their message and yet strongly contradict each other in their teachings, only verifiable, objective evidence, proof or evidence can make clear which of the two is divinely inspired. The Bible has partial proof in the Tanakh, which largely agrees with the Old Testament. Where is such evidence for the Qur'an, which is even older than the Qur'an itself?

5 The distinctive and vowel signs of the Arabic language were only introduced when the Qur'an was already widely used. However, such signs can significantly change the meaning of words. When these signs were introduced, there were heated discussions about many such meanings. Why did God not introduce these signs at the time of the creation of the Qur'an in order to write this book clearly?

6. it is proven that the Qur'an in its present form was only created after the death of Muhammad, under the caliph Uthman ibn Affan ( عثمان بن عفان ). Zaid ibn Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak al-Ansari ( زيد بن ثابت بن الضحاك الأنصاري ) was commissioned to compile and write down the Qur'an. This edition is known as Mishkat al-Masabih ( مشکوۃ المصابیح ). Why are the other writers less trustworthy? They would be witnesses for the correctness of the Qur'an. Instead, Uthman ordered the destruction of all manuscripts other than his revised text. These included the four versions of the Hijazi, Kufic, Basran and Syriac texts. This situation makes my stomach ache when I examine this book!

7 According to most Islamic scholars, the Qur'an cannot be interpreted without the tradition (=Ahadith) of its prophet Muhammad, whose life is regarded as the interpretation of the Qur'an. However, the ahadith do not give us a complete and accurate picture of Muhammad. In addition, these traditions were only collected and recorded three centuries later. Their selection, which makes up only 7 percent of all traditions, was again only witnessed by a single person.
They are also not documented by several witnesses!

It therefore remains to be said that the Qur'an cannot really be regarded as an eternal book, as there are far too many ambiguities in its tradition and interpretation.

Because if they're supporting those types of actions while claiming to not be the type of monster to support those action and condemning those actions when commited by any other group than the one they have ties to then yeah we should call out their bias.

I'm Canadian and Canada has commited genocide and continues to have issues with the treatment of its indigenous populations.
If I were to call out Australia regularly but make excuses or downplay the actions and history of Canada it would be perfectly fair to call me out as biased even if I denied it.

David is  it consistent on the issue of war crimes because he reports on Israel differently and less aggressively than other nations that engage in similar activity.

Evangelical Christians also don't because of their prophecy about the end of the world as do other groups.

Without further context from the video or comment thread, it's difficult to definitively say if this is intended as a critique of those actions or a support of them. However, the term 'jihad' can be interpreted in various ways, and in the context of this conflict, it is often used to describe Palestinian resistance which could be seen as pro-Palestine, or as a critique of Palestinian actions which could be interpreted as pro-Israel or neutral. Given the ambiguity and potential for negative framing of 'Jehadi' actions, it leans towards a critical stance of a particular ideology associated with some Palestinian factions, without necessarily supporting Israel directly. It is more likely a criticism of a specific ideology rather than a direct support of Israel. However, given the lack of explicit support for Palestine and the negative framing of 'Jehadi', it's safest to label it as potentially critical of a faction within the conflict, and thus not clearly pro-Palestine.",51

The story of Palestine 

It begins in the French campaign against Egypt and the Levant. Napoleon hoped to find an ally in the middle of the Arab countries to help him rule the region. In the end, he called on the Jews to gather the Jews of the world in a national homeland in Palestine, so that they would be close to Egypt and the Levant and help him rule this country. The country, but before this is implemented Napoleon is defeated. 

Whose idea continues to exist and is being adopted by rich men, thinkers, writers, and journalists, and the most important of these men are Theodor Hurdzel and the billionaire Ro Chiel. 

Henzel then began writing a book about the establishment of the Jewish state and revived the idea in the hearts of the Jews. 

In his book he proposed four places of residence for the Jewish state and these countries were Argentina, Palestine, Aguanda and Mozambique. 

After a period of time, the first Zionist conference took place at the end of the nineteenth century, in which Palestine was agreed upon as a national homeland for the Jews. 

Then comes Rochild's turn, which begins to finance the displacement of some Jews to Palestine, buys some lands for them, and establishes the first Jewish settlement in Palestine. Now you will imagine that the Palestinians were the ones who sold their land to the Jews, but at this time the Jewish population in Palestine was only 3 percent who were residents of the Palestinian state and lived in peace in a stable Palestinian homeland under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Regarding the issue of selling lands to the Jews, the Palestinians were asking the Ottoman Empire to prevent the immigration of Jews and sell lands to them, but due to the weakness of the state and its near collapse, they did not respond to the Palestinians’ request.
After that, the Ottoman Empire disintegrates, and Palestine falls into the hands of England, which had the same idea as Napoleon, to have an ally in the Palestinian territories, who would be a follower of England, present among the Arab lands to help them rule them and create problems for them to distract them from Britain, and the British were able to take resources from them and do whatever they wanted. With the help of an ally.
In 1917, Belford, the British Foreign Minister, gave a pledge to the Jews to give them Palestine to establish their Jewish state.
Thus, England helps the Jews immigrate and owns Palestinian lands by force
After that, the Palestinians begin to create resistance and hold many meetings and conferences in attempts to preserve their country
But the British state considers them not to want peace, and in return, it gives weapons to the Jews and begins the massacres of the Palestinians.
However, due to the revolt of the Palestinians, their cessation of work, and the establishment of the state, Britain proposes that they establish a Palestinian state and a Jewish state, but the Palestinians refuse.
At this time, Israel owned only 5 and a half percent of the Palestinian lands through theft and usurpation, but the population of Palestine was 30 percent of them Jews.
The resistance continues and the Zionists continue their armed aggression against Palestine
Britain then leaves Palestine in this state of conflict
This matter was left to the United Nations, which had an interest in having an ally in the middle of the Arab countries and giving the Jews 56% of the Palestinian land.
Of course, the Palestinians refuse and ask for help from the Arab countries, but unfortunately the Arab army is defeated in 1948.
The Zionists occupy 78% of the land through usurpation and theft
They were expanding and expelling the Palestinians from their land and expelling them from their homes where the Jews lived.
Now the picture has become clear about the oppressor and the oppressed, and it has become clear why the Palestinians do not want peace. Naturally, you do not want to share what was stolen from you with the thief, and now they have tried to take their country. They call them terrorism, cut off all means of life, and slander them brutally, and I cannot believe it.

The phrase 'Mere dil mai humanity nahi hai' (There is no humanity in my heart) suggests an extreme, almost nihilistic stance that doesn't clearly align with either side's stated goals, but the desire for Israel to use such weapons is highly problematic and unusual. Given the wording, it's difficult to definitively categorize. However, the call for Israel to use these weapons could be interpreted as a hostile statement towards Israel's perceived enemies, which might indirectly support certain radical factions' aims against Israel, or it could be an expression of extreme frustration and pain that is not clearly directed.

GENEVA (11 May 2023) – On the one-year anniversary of Shireen Abu Akleh’s killing, UN experts raised the alarm today that justice for the journalist’s death has been denied.
“After a year, Israeli authorities have failed to hold the perpetrators of Abu Akleh’s killing accountable, while independent investigations have pointed at the culpability of Israeli forces. Justice remains, again, hostage of politics,” the experts said.  
Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist and acclaimed correspondent for Al Jazeera, was shot dead on 11 May 2022, while performing her duty as a journalist reporting on Israel’s raid in the Jenin refugee camp. Several independent investigations carried out by various bodies and organisations, including the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, concluded that Abu Akleh was most likely killed by seemingly well-targeted shots fired by Israeli forces, despite her wearing clear identification as a journalist. Internal investigations carried out by the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) found “a high possibility” that Abu Akleh was “accidentally hit” by IDF gunfire. However, to date, Israeli authorities have not opened a criminal investigation into her death or held anyone accountable.
“So far, every one of the requirements under international law for the investigation of potentially unlawful deaths, namely: promptness, effectiveness and thoroughness, independence and impartiality and transparency, appears to have been violated in this case,” the experts said.
“International law demands, at minimum: an effective, thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into Abu Akleh’s death. These steps must be carried out in accordance with applicable international standards, including the Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016).  Failing to carry out a prompt and effective investigation, followed by prosecution and judicial process, may in itself constitute a violation of the right to life,” they said.
“We also urge the Israeli authorities to ensure that those responsible are held accountable without delay,” the experts said, recalling that Ms. Abu Akleh’s family must have access to justice, truth and adequate reparation, and emphasising that the whole world needs to know what happened.
“The safety of journalists, particularly in situations of conflict and occupation, is critical to support accountability and transparency,” the experts said. “The deliberate killing of a journalist in such situations amounts
to extrajudicial execution, an egregious violation of the right to life, and wilful killing under the fourth Geneva Convention. It is thus paramount that journalists are provided with effective protective measures”.
The experts also decried the record-high number of killings of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in recent months in the context of raids by Israeli forces, often targeting refugee camps. In 2022, out of 9000 Israeli operations, 704 targeted refugee camps in the occupied West Bank. In 2023, already more than 7000 Palestinians have been killed more than 20000 injured in the context of such operations, including in Jenin, Nablus, Jericho and Gaza. Since 2001, at least 21 Palestinian journalists have been reportedly killed by the IDF in the occupied Palestinian territory and no one has been held accountable for those deaths.
“Evidence indicates that the Israeli forces repeatedly deploy lethal force against Palestinians in violation of international law, which prohibits intentional lethal use of firearms except when strictly unavoidable to protect life,” the experts said.
“The killing of Shireen Abu Akleh is symbolic, embodying grave human rights violations that Palestinians have faced under the Israeli occupation for over 55 years,” the experts said. “Their rights to self-determination, life, freedom of expression have been consistently violated. The Palestinian people live under the yoke of pervasive impunity and lack of reparations for violations committed,” they said.
The experts urged the international community to take concrete action in the face of these violations. “The United Nations Charter is betrayed every day in the occupied Palestinian territory,” they said.      
The experts raised the matter with the Israeli Government and duly called for a prompt, transparent, thorough and independent investigation into Abu Akleh’s death, for which they also offered their specialised forensic assistance and technical advice. The Israeli Government has not responded to the communication to date.",P,"Confidence: High | This comment extensively details reports from UN experts criticizing Israel's actions regarding the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh and other Palestinians.

There is zero authority to whom he checks with ( certainly not with the USA), nor accountability to the USA for his choices, deals and power which he allocates as he sees fit, “ personally.”

He apparently has zero concern nor allegiance to the USA, just does what he wants

right now he is more dangerous than any country to the United States, because he is acting as if and probably seen as if, he is a representative on the behalf of the United States. But he is not.

the impacts of his actions should be at the highest concerns to our country 

earlier this month he blocked Ukrainian missiles by cutting their Internet off, intentionally. ???????

Dear Respected All, Peace and Blessings. 

Palestine: The Truth Must Be Known (Synopsis) 

In 1896, an enlightened White Austro-Hungarian European Zionist, Theodore Herzle, conceived a brazen political vision for Jews to have a separate national home in Palestine. Twenty-one years later, this cynical ideology and sinister agenda to transfer world Jewry into Palestine gained momentum and led to the presumptuous Balfour Declaration of 1917 in which the British connived and promised “a national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine. Both treacherous schemes were hatched without consulting the indigenous Palestinian people, vehemently against their popular democratic will and contrary to their right to national independence and self-determination as a distinct sovereign people. 

The stage has been set and the Zionist master plan was expeditiously put into motion. By the mid-1930s tens of thousands of foreign Jews forcibly entered Palestine thus provoking a failed Arab Revolt. This mass illegal influx of European Jews further heightened later in the early 1940s under the British Mandate, following the Holocaust in Germany. 

Some thirty years thereafter or just over half a century from inception, at the world stage, conspiracies against the Palestinian people took on a more insidious and repugnant reality. On November 29, 1947 in a dramatic move, the UN unilaterally determined that Palestine must be taken from its indigenous population and awarded to alien White European Zionist Jewish refugees. Again, as in the fateful years of 1896 and 1917, the contrived UN Partition Plan was hastily adopted without consulting the indigenous Palestinian people themselves, in utter contempt, lack of respect for their right to self-determination and the complete disregard for the national independence, the territorial sovereignty and integrity of their country. 

More decisively as facts on the ground unfortunately unfolded rapidly, the ambitions European Jews then unleashed the monstrous Plan Dalet and the shock and horror began in Palestine! At great speed, the dreadful Nakba emerged as Zionist mercenaries forcefully usurped the land, confiscated private property, killed thousands (even animals) and drove hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their own country as displaced and beleaguered refugees. Indeed, heavily supported by the self-righteous West, the embryonic Zionist Apartheid entity boastfully declared itself on May 15, 1948, through a brutal military campaign perpetrated by three well-known Zionist terrorist groups: the Stern Gang, the Haganah and Irgun. 

Ever since, these very terrorists became an integral part of the seminal Zionist Apartheid regime and its IDF, both of which together in unison continue with gross impunity to occupy, oppress, terrorize and commit genocide against the indigenous Palestinian population struggling for their freedom. 
Again, this injustice with the full, unhinged, sustained and unconditional political, financial and military support of the civilized democratic West, led primarily by the United States and its staunch allies. 

For well over 75 hopeless years of blatant injustice, Zionist propaganda machine was busy flooding the world consciousness with blatant lies and heinous deception in order to achieve their malign goals. Plagued by cruel, illegal and inhumane Zionist Apartheid occupation and genocide in Palestine, the disenfranchised Palestinian people reserve the legitimate, legal and moral right and are indeed compelled to fight for the liberation of their homeland by any and every means possible. 

Palestinians are NOT 'terrorists'! Despite the enormous political, economic and military challenges, constraints and struggles they are enduring, they are legitimate, admirable and determined freedom fighters and heroes, deserving of full respect, encouragement and every support necessary for their ultimate victory. 

Indeed, the passive international community likewise has a binding, legitimate, legal and moral obligation to stop the bold Zionist Apartheid crimes, atrocities, disenfranchisement, military occupation, ethnic cleansing, economic strangulation and genocide against the indigenous Palestinian people, commited every day before our eyes. 

The sad reality is that after 75 grueling years of the unabated recalcitrance of Zionist Apartheid occupation and genocide, nothing really meaningful has been done to seriously address the Palestinian issue justly by world leaders, including the very UN, which played a decisive role in institutionally augmenting the problem in the first place, instead of averting it completely. Indeed, the United States and its close allies in their malign agenda and ulterior motives, callously continue to openly block and obstruct any progress for peace, regional stability and justice on the Palestine Question. 

It is time for Justice! Palestine must be completely liberated from Zionist Apartheid brutalization, occupation and genocide. The Palestinian people are entitled to enjoy the same basic rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and dignity that every human being deserves. The world can no longer sit and wait idly by, in silence or indifference. It's now time to act decisively, not merely because it is a collective responsibility, but truly as a high moral duty to defend the truth and justice and achieve a durable and lasting peace on this most vexing and enduring issue of Palestine entrusted upon mankind. One way or another, Palestinian victory is inevitable! 

Thank you.

We, the American Indian Empowerment PAC, hereby issue this Cease and Desist notice to all legal, elected, appointed, juristic, citizens, residents, resident aliens, for-profit and non-profit corporate persons, and all other non-governmental organizations under the jurisdiction of the United States.

It has come to our attention that individuals, organizations, and corporations are deliberately misclassifying Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent as “Underserved” “Marginalized” “Minorities” “Communities of color”  ""Black"" or ""African American"" for profit. This misclassification violates treaties, constitutions, and covenants, and it is imperative that this practice be discontinued immediately.

Misidentifying Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent as ""Black"" or ""African American"" erases their unique cultural heritage and history, infringing upon their right to self-determination and self-identification. The Indian Bill of Rights, Indian Civil Rights Act, and American Indian Self-determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 were enacted to protect the rights of American Indians and colonial European descent Americans. Furthermore, treaties such as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the Treaty with the Cherokee, and the Treaty of Delaware were established to safeguard the sovereignty and self-determination of American Indian tribes. The Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the United States also ensure the fundamental rights of all Americans, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Additionally, the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination and the preservation of their cultural identity.

By perpetuating the false belief in race and imposing the identity of ""Black"" or ""African American"" on Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent, these individuals, organizations, and corporations are promoting a caste system identity that does not exist and undermining the principles of liberty and justice for all upon which the United States of America was founded.

Therefore, we demand that all social media companies, elected officials, public servants, public corporations, and their agents and partners immediately cease and desist from using terms such as FBA, Black, Afro-American, African Americans, minorities, people of color, communities of color, ADOS, or any other marketing slogan or racist term to describe and determine the identity of Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent with ruddy, tawny, brunette, fair, swarthy, and dark skin tones as ""Black"" or ""African American.""

Failure to comply with this Cease and Desist notice will result in legal action to protect the rights and identities of Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent.

This notice is issued under the authority of PUBLIC LAW 93-638, Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA), 25 U.S.C.§§ 1301-1304 (ICRA).

Sincerely,
American Indian Empowerment PAC

    Jews in Ottoman:

       Among the few inhabitants of Constantinople ( after victory of Constantinople in 1453 by Mehmet-II, Ottoman Sultan)  to have survived the Turkish seizure of the city were the Jews of the Balat quarter. Not long after the appointment of Gennadius ( the priest, first patriarch of Orthodox welcomed by Mehmed, after fall of Constantinople in 1453 ) or perhaps at the same time, Mehmed also selected a chief rabbi to preside over all the Jewish congregations of Turkey. His choice fell on Moshe Capsali, a man of piety and learning, founder of a celebrated family of scholars; Elijah Capsali, who in the sixteenth century wrote a Hebrew history of the Ottoman Empire that is still awaiting publication, may have been descended from him. The sultan, we are told, even made him a member of the imperial council (divan) , where he was honored by a seat next to the mufti, thus gaining precedence over the Greek patriarch; furthermore, he delegated to Cap_xFFFE_sali certain political powers over the Jewish congregations of Turkey. It was Moshe Capsali who assigned the taxes to be paid individually or collectively by the Jews, appointed officials to collect them, and transmitted 
 the proceeds to the sultan's treasury. He also possessed penal authority over all members of the Jewish community and the right to confirm the appointment of rabbis. In a word, he was the head and official representative of the Jewish community in the Ottoman Empire. 
             Under the Conqueror, if the accounts of Jewish contemporaries are to be believed, Turkey was a paradise for the Jews, who were cruelly oppressed in Western Europe. Jewish emigrants from Germany were overjoyed at the favored position of the Jews in Turkey. They were free to 
live and trade as they pleased. There was no ""golden penny"" to pay, no crown taxes amounting to a third of their fortune. They could dispose freely of their property and dress as they saw fit, in silk and satin if they wished. Their enterprise found rich sources of profit, though it is true that they were soon obliged to limit their activities to commerce and moneylending. In 1454 Isaac Sarfati, a Jew born in Germany of French descent, sent a circular letter to the Jews of the Rhineland, Swabia, Styria, Moravia, and Hungary in which he spoke with enthusiasm of the fortunate conditions of the Jews under the Crescent in contrast to their yoke under the Cross, and encouraged his coreligionaries to leave the ""great torture chamber"" and come to Turkey. The years that followed witnessed a massive emigration of Jews to the Turkish paradise, especially from Germany. Certain countries, Italy in particular, prevented their Jews from leaving.""

      ""  There can be no doubt about Mehmed's religious tolerance. If even a part of what Isaac Sarfati wrote from Turkey in his circular letter of 1454 to the Jews of Central Europe about the favorable situation of his coreligionaries under the Crescent was true, Mehmed's empire must have been a paradise for non-Moslem subjects (reaya) , especially Jews. Turkey, Sarfati wrote, was a country where nothing was lacking. Every man could spend his life unmolested under his fig tree and his vine. In judging this letter with its invitation to emigrate to the Ottoman Empire, we must not, of course, forget that the situation of the Jews in Central Europe in the middle of the fifteenth century was particularly wretched, that they were subject to incessant persecution, and that measured by these condi_xFFFE_tions, Turkey, where no one was molested for his faith, could promise a truly blissful life. It must also be borne in mind that in his commercial undertakings and his fiscal policy, Mehmed preferred to rely on the help of Jews, including his physician Maestro lacopo, whom he sometimes, to the dissatisfaction of the Moslems, employed as his financial adviser. But also in Christian quarters, as it is more than once confirmed, each man could ""seek salvation in his own way,"" complete religious freedom prevailed, and no one incurred serious difficulties because of his faith. There can be no doubt that the Christian inhabitants of places far from the seat of government were often oppressed and unjustly treated, but it is equally certain that this was not the work of the supreme authorities. The truly magnanimous treatment of non-Moslems in the Ottoman Empire under Mehmed can in large measure be attributed to his indulgence and mildness in religious matters, qualities which were in all likelihood closely related to his own liberal ideas on religion.""

While aggressive, it appears to be directed at someone or something, and without further context, it's difficult to definitively assign it a stance towards the conflict itself. However, the phrasing suggests animosity that could be interpreted as anti-Israel sentiment, which might indirectly align with pro-Palestinian viewpoints in the context of the conflict, but it's not explicit support for Palestine. Given the ambiguity and aggressive tone, 'I' for Israel might be incorrect, but 'P' is also not directly stated. Let's re-evaluate. If it's directed at 'Israel' itself and expressed as a desire to 'hit' it, it's clearly against Israel. In the context of the conflict, an anti-Israel sentiment is usually associated with support for Palestine. However, the phrasing is very colloquial and could be a personal insult. Given the directness of the animosity towards Israel, and the common discourse surrounding the conflict, it leans towards criticism of Israel.

I am a Muslim and I prayed with you in Ohio and I travelled to Utah, California, and Arizona to visit your sacred lands and I went to your powwow and I danced with you. I listened to your elders who spoke of the One God, the divine spirit. I am offering this for the Muslims: ""To each of you we have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If God had willed, He would have made you one community, but his will is test you with what He has given each of you. So compete with one another in doing good."" Kuran 5:48. ""Indeed, the [true] believers, Jews, Sabians, and Christians - whoever truly believes in God and the Last Day and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve."" Kuran 5:69. I share this verse to draw attention to the inclusion of the Sabians - an indigenous group in Northern Iraq who were not Muslim, or Christian, or Jewish.

What was October 7th like on your planet this year? On Earth, Palestinians went on a psychopathic  mass rape, mass murder, mass kidnapping Islamic terror attack. Women and girls were raped to the death. A daycare full of toddlers was massacred. 40 toddlers were decapitated. 1,400 Israelis were murdered, most of whom were unarmed civilians. 

As for here in America. 74% of the population stands against Islam and the bloodthirsty Palestinians, who train their children from birth to believe that their greatest aspiration in life should be to kill Jews.

We, the American Indian Empowerment PAC, hereby issue this Cease and Desist notice to all legal, elected, appointed, juristic, citizens, residents, resident aliens, for-profit and non-profit corporate persons, and all other non-governmental organizations under the jurisdiction of the United States.

It has come to our attention that individuals, organizations, and corporations are deliberately misclassifying Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent as ""Black"" or ""African American"" for profit. This misclassification violates treaties, constitutions, and covenants, and it is imperative that this practice be discontinued immediately.

Misidentifying Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent as ""Black"" or ""African American"" erases their unique cultural heritage and history, infringing upon their right to self-determination and self-identification. The Indian Bill of Rights, Indian Civil Rights Act, and American Indian Self-determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 were enacted to protect the rights of American Indians and colonial European descent Americans. Furthermore, treaties such as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the Treaty with the Cherokee, and the Treaty of Delaware were established to safeguard the sovereignty and self-determination of American Indian tribes. The Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the United States also ensure the fundamental rights of all Americans, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Additionally, the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination and the preservation of their cultural identity.

By perpetuating the false belief in race and imposing the identity of ""Black"" or ""African American"" on Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent, these individuals, organizations, and corporations are promoting a caste system identity that does not exist and undermining the principles of liberty and justice for all upon which the United States of America was founded.

Therefore, we demand that all social media companies, elected officials, public servants, public corporations, and their agents and partners immediately cease and desist from using terms such as FBA, Black, Afro-American, African Americans, minorities, people of color, communities of color, ADOS, or any other marketing slogan or racist term to describe and determine the identity of Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent with ruddy, tawny, brunette, fair, swarthy, and dark skin tones as ""Black"" or ""African American.""

Failure to comply with this Cease and Desist notice will result in legal action to protect the rights and identities of Americans of American Indian and colonial European descent.

This notice is issued under the authority of PUBLIC LAW 93-638, Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA), 25 U.S.C.§§ 1301-1304 (ICRA).

Sincerely,
American Indian Empowerment PAC",N,"Confidence: Low | This comment is a lengthy, complex legalistic text from the 'American Indian Empowerment PAC' concerning racial misclassification and legal codes.

You mean the water that belongs to the west bank, so to Palestine, that they FORBID palestinians to use? They deny access to water courses, they deny permitts to build wells, they even destroy rain water cisterns on palestinian land. Because of this around 180 palestinian communities in the west bank don't have access to running water, even if they are connected to the water network, no water comes through it. 
Meanwhile Mekorot, an israeli state-owned company, built a water network, tapped water springs and sunk wells to service israel and the settlers in the west bank. They sell water to Palestinians only in restricted amounts decided by Israel, and for prices that range between 4 and 10 dollars for cubic liter (which to give you some perspective in my first world country would costs around 60 cents), so for many poor families the cost of water amounts to half their monthly earning. 
So while palestinians struggle to survive, settlers can enjoy their pools and irrigate their fields as much as they want, even just a few hundred meters away.
According to the WHO, the water consumption (drinking, cooking and hygiene) of a person should be around 100 liters per day. An sraeli settler consumes around 300 liters per day, but some west bank palestinian communities have access to as little as 20 liters per day per person. 

Electricity? Still not given for free. What the Israel Electric Corporation provides (still in very restricted amounts) to Gaza, is fully paid by the taxes collected by the Palestinian Authority. In the west bank, while they are running on debt, it's still definetly not donated in any capacity, and  the debt is expected to be payed back.
And I'm sure that if Israel fucked off from the occupied territories, they would enjoy producing their own energy (something they are already working towards) or buying from other nations. 

Jobs? Oh, my! So charitable, aren't they? They allow palestinians to work for them for cheap after having to go through hours of check points. We should give them a humanitarian prize. 
You know in the Jim Crow US, Black people were allowed to have jobs, right? Where they discriminated? Yes. Where their movements controlled? Less than palestinian's but, to a degree, yes. Where they killed? Yes. Where their communities destroyed? Yes. Where they costantly harassed? Yes. Where they treated like subhumans? Yes. Where oppressed by a discriminatory burocratic system? Yes. Where they segregated? Yes. But, ladies and gentlemen, they were allowed to work for the white people! I mean, if the US was really a bad place, they could have gathered them up, built a wall around them, starved them of water and electricity, and let them to die.

Btw no woman could dance like that in any Muslim or Hamas or Palestinian culture so you are against yourselves.",P,"Confidence: Low | This comment expresses strong condemnation of Islamists and Hamas, associating them with violence against Jews. The author states this closes their support for 'MMIW' and 'first nations causes' if they align with these groups. While the author is clearly anti-Hamas and anti-Islamist in this context, the overarching sentiment is a rejection of groups that have aligned with what they perceive as 'bloodthirsty islamist cults', which, by extension, implies a rejection of those aligned groups and their actions, potentially indirectly supporting those who oppose them. However, the language is primarily critical of certain actors rather than explicitly advocating for Israel. The mention of not being able to dance like that 'in any Muslim or Hamas or Palestinian culture' further fuels their strong opposition. This comment is complex, but the intense negative framing of Hamas and Islamists, combined with the implied opposition to their actions, could be interpreted as indirectly aligning with the opposing side, though it's not a direct endorsement of Israel. Given the strong negative sentiment towards a specific group seen as the antagonist in the conflict, and the mention of 'Jews on Oct. 7th', it leans towards a position of opposition to the Palestinian cause as represented by Hamas, but without explicit support for Israel. It's a difficult call between P and I, but the primary focus is on the actions of Islamists and Hamas being grotesque and against specific cultures, rather than a pro-Israel stance.",504

Numbers 23:19-24 (NRSV)  God is not a human being, that he should lie, or a mortal, that he should change his mind. Has he promised, and will he not do it? Has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?
See, I received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.
He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob; nor has he seen trouble in Israel. The LORD their God is with them, acclaimed as a king among them.
God, who brings them out of Egypt, is like the horns of a wild ox for them.
Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, 'See what God has done!'

Hamas is in Gaza. If there is no hamas, people in Gaza will suffer too from Israeli oppression like other Palestinians living in the Occupied West Bank. 

Gaza has been blockaged for decades and called open air prison in the world but I think the condition is better because they still have freedom if compared to the Occupied West Bank.

In West Bank, Palestinians facing humiliation on daily basis, has to get through Israeli military check points when they want to move from another district, being forced out of their own homes to make room for illegal jewish settler coming from USA!, when they fight back they were being imprisoned and thousands of Palestinians is in Israeli jails in The Occupied West Bank without trial and charges. IDF just pick random houses and people, including children, in order to create fear so there will be no resistance movement lika Hamas in Gaza. It's IDF policy (do your research). Disgusting. That's why the area is called ""The Occupied West Bank"".

Hamas did what they have to do on October 7th maybe because they couldn't stand seeing the injustice going on for decades and the suffering of their brothers and sisters in West Bank. That's why Hamas demand to exchange Palestinian prisoner with Israeli hostages. Fair enough.

Former Israeli PM, I forgot his name, on early 1990 decided to leave Gaza and withdraw their illegal jewish settler from Gaza. Why? Because it costs Isareli government a lot of money and effort to suppress the resistance from Palestinians fighter (hamas).

Educate yourself! Do your research from valid sources like Dr. Norman Finkelstein, Dr. Gabor Mate, Prof Ilan Pappe, Rabbi Elhanan Beck, Rabbi Weiss. They all are Jews with academic background, some are Holucaust survivor, and dedicate their lives to open the world's eyes to how Zionist Racist Apartheid State of Israel was created and how evil Israel treat Palestinians people.",P,"Confidence: High | The comment extensively criticizes Israeli policies, describes the conditions in Gaza and West Bank from a pro-Palestinian perspective, references Hamas's actions as a response to injustice, and recommends pro-Palestinian scholars.

If this comment is made in the context of discussions about the Israel-Gaza conflict, it could be interpreted as an attempt to associate a specific group (Muslims) with negative actions, potentially to delegitimize certain narratives, which could align with a pro-Israel or anti-Palestinian sentiment. However, without more context from the preceding comments, it's hard to be definitive. The mention of 'muslims' in a negative context related to a violent act can be a tactic used in some pro-Israel narratives. Given the ambiguity, 'Medium' confidence is assigned. Re-evaluation based on context: If this comment is reacting to a claim that Israeli soldiers committed a crime, and this comment attempts to shift blame to Muslims, it's a tactic of deflection. If it's correcting a detail about an event unrelated to the main conflict, it's neutral. Assuming it's related to the conflict discourse, it might be a veiled criticism or misdirection.",49

The idea for this is very simple: If Palestinians knew the rules of the game , they would calculate and decide wether to interact or not. When you have no idea, no clue what is awaiting you around the corner, that is when you get really terrified.

If it is arbitrary , no one can chose, nothing makes sens so everything makes sens.",P,"Confidence: High | The comment discusses a mission to intimidate people and make them afraid through arbitrary actions, which can be interpreted as a criticism of Israeli tactics of control and intimidation over Palestinians.

It sounds like he wouldn't object to moving people out of Gaza.

To answer your question:
Palestinans attempted coups in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, and most likely Syria. They succeeded in Lebanon.

None of those countries would take them. They don't want to risk another coup. 

Turkey could (and it wouldn't interfere with it's attempted genocide of Kurds).

Azerbaijan could  (and it wouldn't interrupt their war with Armenia).

Iran is having civil unrest. Many  Iranians are protesting, and they shouldn't have to deal with more violence. (Good luck in gaining your freedom!!!)

There are 13,000 UNRWA staff in Gaza.

That’s one UN staff for every 114 refugees in Gaza. Compare that to the largest refugee camp in the world, Cox Bazar with only 1,550 UN staff serving 1.24 million refugees. That’s one UN staff for every 800 refugees. In comparison, there are 7 times more UN staff serving refugees in the Gaza Strip.

There are more UN staff in the Gaza Strip than the total employees of the World Bank with more than 10,000 employees in over 120 offices worldwide?

There are more UN staff in Gaza than in Geneva (8,500 UN staff) or New York (6,400 UN staff)? Gaza has twice as many UN Staff than in New York.

UNRWA leverages the UN brand to appear to casual observers as a team of relatively unbiased international aid workers, when in fact they're a $1 billion/year Palestinian business, run by Palestinians and staffed by Palestinians.

They need Palestinian refugees to exist. If Palestinians got their state, there would be no more ""refugees,"" and the business and flow of aid money would end. It's in their best interests to perpetuate the conflict and leave Palestinian statehood up in the air. UNRWA schools literally taught a whole generation of Gazans to hate their neighbors and make unrealistic demands so that the core issue of sovereignty is never addressed.

Its sole achievements are radicalizing Palestinian children and keeping Palestinians refugees for generations. As you have read in the news recently, they also kept some of the hostages.

UNRWA should have been disbanded decades ago, all they do is perpetuate the conflict and keep Palestinians poor and uneducated.

The increasing frequency of UN posts on Twitter regarding the Palestinian situation in contrast to other conflicts reveals a distinct pattern.  

As the pressure on Hamas tightens, Antonio takes actions that would hinder the eradication of Hamas.  UN agencies are in a campaign against Israel, Led by UN WOMEN who silently betrayed by turning a blind eye to the mass rape.

Antonio is becoming increasingly panicked about what may be discovered once Hamas leaders are interrogated and the money trail investigated.

It's time to sue the United Nations for being a party to terrorism. Israel should build a case, and individual Israelis whose family members suffered in the October 7th terrorist attacks should file a Claim against the UN. Put them on the defensive.

Gaza is a cash cow for the UN.  The moment Hamas goes out so does the cash flow from which the people who really need help don't benefit anyway. Had they really done their jobs then Gazans would fare much better and Oct.07 wouldn't have happened in the first place.",I,"Confidence: High | This comment is a lengthy and strong condemnation of UNRWA and the Palestinian refugee system, framing them as perpetuating conflict and benefiting from the situation.

(translating to 'This is a terrorist...') is a derogatory statement often used in the context of the conflict to label one side. Without further context, and given its common usage against Palestinians in certain discourse, it leans towards an anti-Palestinian/pro-Israeli sentiment if 'ye' refers to Palestinians. However, if it's a response to a comment labeling Hamas, it could be sarcastic. Given the ambiguity and strong negative language, it's difficult to definitively label. If it is a direct accusation of terrorism against Palestinians, it supports Israel. If it's a sarcastic take on someone else's accusation, it's different. Due to the high likelihood of it being a derogatory label against one side, it's classified as P with low confidence, as it's likely an expression of support for Israel by denigrating the opposing side.",25

Yet , even with living Holocaust survivors, the ISRAELIS government told the Israelis that they would be protected by the IDF , so they fell for severe restrictions on private weapons ownership. 
Proving that their IDF and National Guards took to long to stop the terrorist atrocities and hence why so many Israelis were massacred.  If they had rebuked the Israelis government and thrown them out and armed themselves they would have had a better chance of stopping the attacks , even as widespread as they were .

Narrated Anas:

The climate of Medina did not suit some people, so the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered them to follow his shepherd, i.e. his camels, and drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So they followed the shepherd that is the camels and drank their milk and urine till their bodies became healthy. Then they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When the news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he sent some people in their pursuit. When they were brought, he cut their hands and feet and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron.

UgyIEPTpLSlc3eeTcR14AaABAg,ok9NsEkNhLY,@NafGGMU,UCYuQPZIhpcgYC_aC2coK53Q,"Here are the counter arguments…

- Palestine ppl voted Hamas. 
- Hamas is a terrorist org not a resistance. Formed in the 1980s not during British occupation, not during Ottoman occupation n the occupation before that which were the true actual occupation
- Hamas only goal is the destruction of Israel state, which means the genocide of Jews. By this logic, the ppl of Palestine has voted a group of crazy ppl to rule them in return for a state which will only comprise of an ethnics group which are the Arabs
- why I mentioned Arabs above? Because there isn’t ethnic group or state called Palestine existed in our history. I mean the real factual history, not that crap they teach u in schools on trees or caves
- the term Palestine itself is a Hebrew word originating from a group of Greek invader who tried but  failed to occupy the Jewish kingdom aeons ago. The term Palestine originates from another Hebrew word meaning invaders, feel free to look at up.
- no food no medicine in hosp in Gaza why? Because the Hamas terrorist have been using hospital, schools, places of worship to launch their attack, they have underground tunnel from most of these locations. Why? Because international rules of engagement doesn’t allow these places to be attacked during wartime
- why there are no food and other important necessities? Hamas have been proven to steal/rob aid that were meant for the ppl of Palestine. These aid were used as currency etc for exchange to weapon etc to attack Israel and to keep their fighting ongoing. Even chocolate is restricted because Hamas have been stealing them n then selling them for money to fund their terror org. There’s a list of other food which r valuable items which have been either banned/restricted. Now imagine if Gaza was rich with hmm gold diamond or wait…natural oil???? What would that be done with?
- Hamas broke the last ceasefire when they attacked Israel in Oct. So how many ceasefire must Israel accept? Will South Africa accept another cease fire if their enemy were to attack? A ceasefire can only be accepted when it includes terms for hostage to be returned safely and most of all, for Hamas to disarm and surrender. So why didn’t these get included? Is the UN and those 135 countries including SA encouraging Hamas to attack? Do they still want this war to continue? Or is it because war is profitable to be continued regardless how many Palestine or Jews die? No war no conflict means no need for UN to exist 

I used to be a Palestine sympathiser but no longer because I see what this is for it real meaning. The ppl of Palestine n their backers doesn’t want a state of their own because they can’t just fathom the existence of a Jewish state which we know based on history the Jews were persecuted killed exiled etc etc they were never allowed to have a state. The canaanites n Jews have always been there. If there is a tribe to dispute Jews today, it would be the canaanites.but they r gone or genetics mixed with the Jews.

Fast fwd, after Brit left, based on UN mandate, Israel accepted their own state, Palestine ppl wit Arab support said no went to war lost that war…before that Syria and Jordan created state of their own, many were Palestine ppl yet others refused to move them n worse refused to create a state of their own, adamant to take the Israeli state which has always been the state for the Jews. On just need look at the ancient map to see the kingdom of Israel and Judah before the occupation started

This man here is not talking facts nor truth..he is biased, n probably racist himself or using this as a political point to gain votes. . A true leader would stick with the truth no matter how hard it is to swallow, that doesn’t include meeting with HAMAS!!
