1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from â€œforeignâ€ ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.

I was reading this article online and double checked and found the sources on Haaretz and another website confirming it was authentic and couldn't believe the wording and justifications being used against Palestinians. 

The topic on whether palestinians are in famine has come up and become a larger topic since the south africa ICJ case as if citizens in gaza are being starved it strengthen the case against genocide under their argument. In response we've seen many israel politicians try and dispute this claim to underscore the argument. Hence the quote from above from COGAT which argument appears to be because of the genes of gazans they hoard food and therefore can't be harming. Overall besides being Ludacris also dehumanizes Palestinians to some type of sub-human animal. 

This language is nothing new since day one we've seen this tactic that attacks on palestinian citizens from the IDF should not be criticized as Palestinians are lesser than israeli and are deserving of this treatment. Supplying some example below to lend credence to the point.

â€œWe are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly,â€_Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant

""They are not human beings and not even human animals, they are subhuman and that is how they should be treated,""-Arieh King mayor of Jerusalem 

There are many other quotes I will not bother to hunt for them we are all familiar with them. This probably is where israel is the most sloppily at not being able to control the messaging from top down and it going to the bottom and being acted upon

Once again though the quote by COGAT which will be the strong form of evidence for Israel that they are not starving palestinians using this type of language and evidence to dispute the case is crazy to me and shows the government is entrenched in how they view palestinians and why the commit such actions  that target large civilians at a rate that has become historically large. 

Israel needs to stop providing individuals and courts more anecdotal evidence that they are conducting this war in an illegally manner or with any intentions besides Hamas being the main and only target. Because as of now it's hard to argue that the culture in israel doesn't  look at palestinians as humans deserving the basic level of human rights.

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no? 

Personally I think answering in the negative holds some implications.

I usually just lurk on Reddit but been wanting to say something on this.   
I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden which is a traditionally quite ""pro-Palestine"" city due to the considerable background of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants, as well as a history of leftist movements in Sweden in general sympathizing with the Palestinian cause under the trope of an anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist struggle. So essentially while I have my view of the conflict, it goes against the opinion of my city, school, and the social circles I hang around. And I don't say it to people irl either unless I trust them fearing they might react in a seriously negative form, hence the other reason to post it here on Reddit.   
So the Gaza war currently ongoing is atrocious, and no one who isn't sick-minded is glorifying the casualties and deaths of thousands of innocents in the Gaza strip. And this is where I have mixed feelings about said ceasefire and the whole Israel bashing. Israel didn't start this campaign because they thought it was amusing or something, similar atrocities happened on the 7th of October where almost 1200 Israelis were killed/kidnapped by Hamas militants. And this is where I see the flaws or inconsistencies of the pro-Palestine side I see, there's the condemnation of what Israel is currently doing. But at least from what I saw there was barely any condemnation of what Hamas did from said pro-Palestine crowds.   
This is kind of infuriating or bizarre to me because the excuses that I was given were either: 1.""Well the Gaza population doesn't represent Hamas"" Obviously not, but neither does the Israeli population represent the Israeli government.   
OR  


2.""Well this wouldn't have happened if Israel didn't....""   
To me is a piss poor argument, because you could rhetorically make the same argument for what Israel is doing rn i.e. ""Well this wouldn't be happening if Hamas didn't..."" etc. Or the idea that 'Extremism breeds extremism"". And by using this logic ""Well if nuh nuh didn't do nuh nuh this wouldn't have..."" Back to almost decades of the conflict. (And I get that you can't discuss this conflict without DEEP historical nuance and understanding but I'm just talking about the Gaza war in the immediate context).  
And so this is where I'm conflicted on the matter. I still maintain the position that I held for years, which is that of the two-state solution.   
But this is impossible because for almost a decade if not longer, only the radicals have had a say on these matters, and this toxicity spreads to rhetoric in the debate in the West.   
Netanyahou's far-right government is not just trampling on Palestine but also endangering Israeli democratic institutions. And then there's the lack of a unified platform for the Palestinian cause in general i.e. Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas being a terrorist organisation that vows the destruction of Israel.  
But in this current affairs, I only see extremists doing the talking and action, so I guess I form my opinion around the extremists. And if there is to be an end to the immediate ongoing conflict, then imo no matter how appalling the casualties for people in the Gaza strip are, Hamas is also responsible for this ongoing horror. And if they continue to exist then they will continue repeating these kind of attacks and Israel will again react and overreact leading to a large number of deaths.   
So the Netanyahu gov. has responsibility for the suffering of people in Gaza rn and for the backpeddling of the two-state solution for almost a decade. In the immediate term, Hamas must cease to exist for everyone's sake as they are an obvious destabilizing factor not just for Israel and Palestine. But the wholeÂ regionÂ too.

This is a video made by YouTube creator Johnny Harris explaining the divide-and-conqueror strategy used by the Israeli far right to derail any prospect of a Palestinian state. He shows documents and even a recording of Netanyahu explaining his strategy to keep expanding into the West Bank. Netanyahu and the Israeli far right had been dead set on derailing peace going all the way back to the Oslo Accords fanning the flames of hate that led to Yitzhak Rabin's assassination.

Going back to the election of Hamas he points out how many within the Israeli government were actually to see Hamas put in power because it gave them the ability to divide the Palestinian movement and that they can treat Gaza like a hostile country. It also gives the Israeli people a boogie man to be afraid of to sabotage any appetite for peace hence why the government covertly supported them. While supporting this violent status quo the Israeli far right could keep carving up the West Bank and slowly annexing the territory while making the lives of Palestinian people unbearable. For a while, this status quo or ""One State Reality"" seemed to work, until October 7th.

I know I'm gonna get accused of sympathizing with Hamas so I'm gonna put it out there that what happened on October 7th was squarely the fault of Hamas and its leaders but as the video points out Hamas was allowed to exist and stay in power because it served a political purpose for the Israeli government, they knew this was dangerous and put people at risk but Netanyahu and the Israeli far right kept this strategy up because it served their goal of driving out the Palestinian population and annexing the land.",Proof that Netanyahu and the Israeli far right used Hamas to divide and conquer Palestinian territor,0.46,2024-01-17 14:24:01,accept narrative hamas put power israelnetanyahu sabotage peace process didnt palestinian overthrow hamas obvious strategy hurt personally dont think israel much effect vast majority palestinian would propped hamas regardless considering much support get,video made youtube creator johnny harris explaining divideandconqueror strategy used israeli far right derail prospect palestinian state show document even recording netanyahu explaining strategy keep expanding west bank netanyahu israeli far right dead set derailing peace going way back oslo accord fanning flame hate led yitzhak rabins assassination going back election hamas point many within israeli government actually see hamas put power gave ability divide palestinian movement treat gaza like hostile country also give israeli people boogie man afraid sabotage appetite peace hence government covertly supported supporting violent status quo israeli far right could keep carving west bank slowly annexing territory making life palestinian people unbearable status quo one state reality seemed work october 7th know im gon na get accused sympathizing hamas im gon na put happened october 7th squarely fault hamas leader video point hamas allowed exist stay power served political purpose israeli government knew dangerous put people risk netanyahu israeli far right kept strategy served goal driving palestinian population annexing land,I,"Confidence: High | The comment challenges the premise of the post, which suggests Israel/Netanyahu intentionally empowered Hamas.

The gas lighting to deflect is not only sad and pathetic, but it's dangerous. There are so many vulnerable people confused and being fed misinformation. This is my attempt at clearing up any confusion.

1. Palestine is an apartheid state. FALSE. The IDF actually LEFT occupation of Gaza in 2005 (corrected) because they were not getting anywhere with helping establish a lawful and structured situation. It makes more sense for them to want a peaceful relationship than to cause oppression because, quite frankly, they don't want the headache. They would have stayed in Gaza if they were hell bent on apartheid (see 2 sources below in the comments section). Further, they were increasing the amount of Palestinians they allowed into Israel to work because there was no economy in Palestine. Occupation to ensure safety is not the same as total control to the point that citizens cannot democratically cast their votes in elections, and total dehumanization of a race, for which South African Apartheid was coined. Mexicans have as much trouble on the boarder of the US as do Palestinians. Thatâ€™s boarder control. 
2. The IDF is committing Genocide. FALSE. They bombed to gain control of Gaza. Hamas on the other hand has Genocide as their intent for all Jews written in their Covenant. What is this ""cease fire?"" They are still there because they need to ensure the safety of the Israeli people. 

The living conditions of Palestinians were of developing world conditions before this war due to Iranian funded MILLIONS going only to funding weapons and for the creation of an intricate tunnel system with the intent to attack Israel. Israel can only do so much with neighbors who are hell bent on their destruction. Israel is the one with the Iron Dome, not Palestine. Stop gaslighting that Palestinians are the only innocent victims. Where is your same outrage for Oct 7th ? Why have you not condemned Hamas ? No one is as worried or concerned of racial cleansing of Jews. 

The fact of the matter is, Hamas and Iran, and other Arab countries who are not open to Westernization, are hell bent on the ELIMINATION of Israel, to control the Middle East and kill the Jews. There is your ""genocide."" Stop spinning the narrative after Israel defends itself. It's just too bad that people don't like Jews and absolutely refuse to accept Israel as a country, because Israel isn't going anywhere.

When they got to the street where my studio is located, a cvilian shot and killed them.

2 other innocent people are dead.

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in.

Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel).

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no?

On the other, within 24 hours on October 10, Israel military carried out three air strikes on the Rafah border. ""As a result, the border and its surrounding area was left in tatters, and roads were impossible to drive on"" and ""the border crossing was essentially inoperable"".([https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20231103-the-gaza-egypt-rafah-crossing-explained-it-is-not-a-normal-border](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20231103-the-gaza-egypt-rafah-crossing-explained-it-is-not-a-normal-border))

How do we move forward when religion is preventing this conflict from being resolved? Israeli Jews want to live in peace with Jewish self determination and statehood in the land of Israel. Palestinian Muslims want the occupation to end, and to live in the land they were displaced from and the broader Muslim world would like to see pan-Islamism. These two goals are antithetical. They are two liberation movements that physically can't coexist on the same piece of land and they have only led to an endless cycle of violence and oppression.

I guess the hope is that eventually Palestinians and neighbouring countries will be convinced through strength and domination and the rest of the world will be convinced legally.

Can we ever expect moderate voices to rise to leadership and find some sort of detante? Can the extremism be controlled on both side? Must Gaza and the West Bank remain under military occupation? Religious attachment land seems impossible to overcome. If Jews could return to Israel after 1800 years in exile, you can't expect Palestinians and Muslims to ever give up there dreams of right of return and pan-islamism. The wars/violence unfortunately seem inevitable :(

A central issue that seems to crop up very often in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the events of 1947 and 1948. Palestinians call it the Nakba (Arabic for catastrophe), while Israelis call it the war of independence. 

My point here is not to rehash the events of that time period, but rather to point out that it would be better for all involved if everyone could move on from the events of that time period (stop trying to change the past and stop ignoring reality). 

To be clear, this does not mean we should ignore or forget history. There are many lessons to be learned from history, and history is incredibly important to all cultures. Just as I would never expect anyone who is Jewish to forget or forgive the Holocaust, I donâ€™t expect anyone who is Palestinian to do those same things when it comes to the Nakba. 

The main difference between the reactions of those affected by the Holocaust and those affected by the Nakba are that Germany does not have their legitimacy constantly questioned as a result of their actions. The world is not still fighting WWII. While there is a difference between those two situations as the Germans have a long history of atoning for their actions over the past 75 years, the basic premise is the same. In order to have peace people must be able to move on from past trauma and stop fighting the same old fight.

I just feel that there wonâ€™t be peace between Israelis and Palestinians until both groups are able to fully recognize that the other group isnâ€™t going anywhere, and that the people of today are not the same as 75 years ago. I also feel that outside actors continue to perpetuate the conflict by denying the legitimacy of Israel because of the way it was established.

I usually just lurk on Reddit but been wanting to say something on this.   
I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden which is a traditionally quite ""pro-Palestine"" city due to the considerable background of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants, as well as a history of leftist movements in Sweden in general sympathizing with the Palestinian cause under the trope of an anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist struggle. So essentially while I have my view of the conflict, it goes against the opinion of my city, school, and the social circles I hang around. And I don't say it to people irl either unless I trust them fearing they might react in a seriously negative form, hence the other reason to post it here on Reddit.   
So the Gaza war currently ongoing is atrocious, and no one who isn't sick-minded is glorifying the casualties and deaths of thousands of innocents in the Gaza strip. And this is where I have mixed feelings about said ceasefire and the whole Israel bashing. Israel didn't start this campaign because they thought it was amusing or something, similar atrocities happened on the 7th of October where almost 1200 Israelis were killed/kidnapped by Hamas militants. And this is where I see the flaws or inconsistencies of the pro-Palestine side I see, there's the condemnation of what Israel is currently doing. But at least from what I saw there was barely any condemnation of what Hamas did from said pro-Palestine crowds.   
This is kind of infuriating or bizarre to me because the excuses that I was given were either: 1.""Well the Gaza population doesn't represent Hamas"" Obviously not, but neither does the Israeli population represent the Israeli government.   
OR  


2.""Well this wouldn't have happened if Israel didn't....""   
To me is a piss poor argument, because you could rhetorically make the same argument for what Israel is doing rn i.e. ""Well this wouldn't be happening if Hamas didn't..."" etc. Or the idea that 'Extremism breeds extremism"". And by using this logic ""Well if nuh nuh didn't do nuh nuh this wouldn't have..."" Back to almost decades of the conflict. (And I get that you can't discuss this conflict without DEEP historical nuance and understanding but I'm just talking about the Gaza war in the immediate context).  
And so this is where I'm conflicted on the matter. I still maintain the position that I held for years, which is that of the two-state solution.   
But this is impossible because for almost a decade if not longer, only the radicals have had a say on these matters, and this toxicity spreads to rhetoric in the debate in the West.   
Netanyahou's far-right government is not just trampling on Palestine but also endangering Israeli democratic institutions. And then there's the lack of a unified platform for the Palestinian cause in general i.e. Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas being a terrorist organisation that vows the destruction of Israel.  
But in this current affairs, I only see extremists doing the talking and action, so I guess I form my opinion around the extremists. And if there is to be an end to the immediate ongoing conflict, then imo no matter how appalling the casualties for people in the Gaza strip are, Hamas is also responsible for this ongoing horror. And if they continue to exist then they will continue repeating these kind of attacks and Israel will again react and overreact leading to a large number of deaths.   
So the Netanyahu gov. has responsibility for the suffering of people in Gaza rn and for the backpeddling of the two-state solution for almost a decade. In the immediate term, Hamas must cease to exist for everyone's sake as they are an obvious destabilizing factor not just for Israel and Palestine. But the wholeÂ regionÂ too.

There is the claim that if the Palestinians had invested all the funds from the donations in building a better life for their people the situation there could have been much better.

For example, they could build bunkers for their citizens instead of a tunnel system for Hamas.

On the other hand, pro-Palestinians claim that the money comes through Israel and Israel would not let them live a good life or build bunkers for civilians.

My question is if Israel is  in control of the money and material that goes into Gaza how is it possible that they built a tunnel system bigger than the tunnel system of New York City?
Where did they get all the weapons?
Was it also under Israeli supervision?
The Israelis told them, well, can you build a system of tunnels to fight us? It's ridiculous.

If Hamas had enough money and material to build tunnels for themselves, they had enough money and material to build shelters for their citizens.

By the way, Israel is not the only one that borders Gaza, it is very convenient to forget that the Egyptian blockade is more severe than the Israeli one.
The Egyptians are bitter rivals of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas is an organization of the Muslim Brotherhood.

I personally think that if there was a good life in Gaza, the aid money would stop coming, and this is very scary for the leaders of Hamas who, as we know, live in Qatar a luxury life because of the donations .

HAMAS is the one who started this war. Every person killed during the war would be alive today if it were not for Oct 7th attack. The HAMAS leaders also use Palestinians as human shields and steal Palestinian aid. They want people to die because it is a religious honor to die Shaheed.

The gas lighting to deflect is not only sad and pathetic, but it's dangerous. There are so many vulnerable people confused and being fed misinformation. This is my attempt at clearing up any confusion.

1. Palestine is an apartheid state. FALSE. The IDF actually LEFT occupation of Gaza in 2005 (corrected) because they were not getting anywhere with helping establish a lawful and structured situation. It makes more sense for them to want a peaceful relationship than to cause oppression because, quite frankly, they don't want the headache. They would have stayed in Gaza if they were hell bent on apartheid (see 2 sources below in the comments section). Further, they were increasing the amount of Palestinians they allowed into Israel to work because there was no economy in Palestine. Occupation to ensure safety is not the same as total control to the point that citizens cannot democratically cast their votes in elections, and total dehumanization of a race, for which South African Apartheid was coined. Mexicans have as much trouble on the boarder of the US as do Palestinians. Thatâ€™s boarder control. 
2. The IDF is committing Genocide. FALSE. They bombed to gain control of Gaza. Hamas on the other hand has Genocide as their intent for all Jews written in their Covenant. What is this ""cease fire?"" They are still there because they need to ensure the safety of the Israeli people. 

The living conditions of Palestinians were of developing world conditions before this war due to Iranian funded MILLIONS going only to funding weapons and for the creation of an intricate tunnel system with the intent to attack Israel. Israel can only do so much with neighbors who are hell bent on their destruction. Israel is the one with the Iron Dome, not Palestine. Stop gaslighting that Palestinians are the only innocent victims. Where is your same outrage for Oct 7th ? Why have you not condemned Hamas ? No one is as worried or concerned of racial cleansing of Jews. 

The fact of the matter is, Hamas and Iran, and other Arab countries who are not open to Westernization, are hell bent on the ELIMINATION of Israel, to control the Middle East and kill the Jews. There is your ""genocide."" Stop spinning the narrative after Israel defends itself. It's just too bad that people don't like Jews and absolutely refuse to accept Israel as a country, because Israel isn't going anywhere.

Coming into Israel daily to work were peaceful but they were gathering intel for mass murder and rape and then celebrated the deaths and rapes.",IsraelPalestine,2024-01-17 15:21:23,198r62k,FluffyKittyParty,0.0,1.0,2020-10-03 15:01:34,43993.0,0.0,"This is more of just a general question on a one state solution, but hear me out. 

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no? 

Personally I think answering in the negative holds some implications.

1858,kiak0oj,1.0,"I spoke about Oct 7th specifically, because you, as you say, didnt support what happened but could ""understand"" it. As if that was any better. 

No one should offer any understanding to that act of barbarism, because that was all it was. Pure evil, disgusting and inhumane. It destroyed whatever goodwill was left between Israel and Palestinians for the next few decades. It hardened even the lefty types in Israel and united them all in supporting what has become a devestating retaliation on the Gazans. 

The fact that you even try to ""understand"" it and the fact that you think Israel has done anything that even remotely compares is shocking. It truly is a testament to the warping of Pro Palestinian minds that the depravity seen on Oct 7th is somehow the same as what Israel does. 

Show me one video of Israel's treament of Palestinians that even compares to the sickening inhumanity that Palestinians filmed themselves doing on Oct 7th. I've never been blind to the mistreatment Palestinians face from Israel and there have been plenty of videos of soldiers harassing people, taking them out of their homes, hitting and injuring and even sometimes killing people, but if you think the intent and the methods are the same, then you truly have no moral compass. 

BTW its interesting that in all this you yourself still see Hamas as somehow representative of the Palestinians in their struggle against Israel. That is very telling. Pro Palestinians on this sub harp on and on about Pro Israelis not distinguishing Hamas from Palestinians, but the fact that you keep insisting Hamas was ""resisting"" against a ""foot on their neck"" for so long, when in reality they were just being used as pawns by Iran and Russia in their attempt to distract the West from Ukraine, is morbidly amusing.",IsraelPalestine,2024-01-17 15:49:44,198pp9l,nbtsnake,0.0,1.0,2013-01-23 07:46:43,4491.0,50.0,"Aight, heading into this and have no idea what I'm getting into. I usually just lurk on Reddit but been wanting to say something on this.   
I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden which is a traditionally quite ""pro-Palestine"" city due to the considerable background of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants, as well as a history of leftist movements in Sweden in general sympathizing with the Palestinian cause under the trope of an anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist struggle. So essentially while I have my view of the conflict, it goes against the opinion of my city, school, and the social circles I hang around. And I don't say it to people irl either unless I trust them fearing they might react in a seriously negative form, hence the other reason to post it here on Reddit.   
So the Gaza war currently ongoing is atrocious, and no one who isn't sick-minded is glorifying the casualties and deaths of thousands of innocents in the Gaza strip. And this is where I have mixed feelings about said ceasefire and the whole Israel bashing. Israel didn't start this campaign because they thought it was amusing or something, similar atrocities happened on the 7th of October where almost 1200 Israelis were killed/kidnapped by Hamas militants. And this is where I see the flaws or inconsistencies of the pro-Palestine side I see, there's the condemnation of what Israel is currently doing. But at least from what I saw there was barely any condemnation of what Hamas did from said pro-Palestine crowds.   
This is kind of infuriating or bizarre to me because the excuses that I was given were either: 1.""Well the Gaza population doesn't represent Hamas"" Obviously not, but neither does the Israeli population represent the Israeli government.   
OR  


2.""Well this wouldn't have happened if Israel didn't....""   
To me is a piss poor argument, because you could rhetorically make the same argument for what Israel is doing rn i.e. ""Well this wouldn't be happening if Hamas didn't..."" etc. Or the idea that 'Extremism breeds extremism"". And by using this logic ""Well if nuh nuh didn't do nuh nuh this wouldn't have..."" Back to almost decades of the conflict. (And I get that you can't discuss this conflict without DEEP historical nuance and understanding but I'm just talking about the Gaza war in the immediate context).  
And so this is where I'm conflicted on the matter. I still maintain the position that I held for years, which is that of the two-state solution.   
But this is impossible because for almost a decade if not longer, only the radicals have had a say on these matters, and this toxicity spreads to rhetoric in the debate in the West.   
Netanyahou's far-right government is not just trampling on Palestine but also endangering Israeli democratic institutions. And then there's the lack of a unified platform for the Palestinian cause in general i.e. Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas being a terrorist organisation that vows the destruction of Israel.  
But in this current affairs, I only see extremists doing the talking and action, so I guess I form my opinion around the extremists. And if there is to be an end to the immediate ongoing conflict, then imo no matter how appalling the casualties for people in the Gaza strip are, Hamas is also responsible for this ongoing horror. And if they continue to exist then they will continue repeating these kind of attacks and Israel will again react and overreact leading to a large number of deaths.   
So the Netanyahu gov. has responsibility for the suffering of people in Gaza rn and for the backpeddling of the two-state solution for almost a decade. In the immediate term, Hamas must cease to exist for everyone's sake as they are an obvious destabilizing factor not just for Israel and Palestine. But the wholeÂ regionÂ too.

On the other, within 24 hours on October 10, Israel military carried out three air strikes on the Rafah border.

1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from â€œforeignâ€ ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.
3) The residents of todays Israel are born and raised there mostly, their grandparents/great grand parents came from Europe and other Jewish diasporas (africa, syria etc), and their closest ancestors have been living there for 70+ years. Iâ€™m from Hungary (not jewish btw, jusr a regular Hungarian person), but looking at my family tree, I have ancestors from Croatia, Germany, Netherlands etc, I would be quite upset if Anyone told me to â€œgo back to Croatia where you came fromâ€. (Or even mongolia where the very ancient Hungarians came from in the 9th century, around the time when Palestine was arabized btw) My great grand father came to Hungary in the late 19th century, I feel no ties whatsoever to that country..

Do you not want a good life?",IsraelPalestine,2024-01-17 08:07:43,198r62k,Optimistbott,0.0,1.0,2019-05-21 00:38:57,2478.0,0.0,"This is more of just a general question on a one state solution, but hear me out. 

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no?

This is extremely telling. Israel is the proving ground. It's where the bullet hits the bone. God either honors the grandiose promises of glory and supremacy He supposedly made to the descendants of Ishmael, or all those promises and prophesies were a bunch of malarkey.

Before the Civil Rights Movement in the USA, American Blacks served an important if deplorable role in the minds of southern American Whites: a permanent underclass, onto which Whites could vent their frustrations without consequence. No matter how hard or unfair life was, a poor White man could (and frequently *did*) take solace in the fact that ""At least I'm not some filthy N-word."" Harassing and mistreating Blacks was a socially sanctioned form of catharsis for many unhappy and unfortunate Whites. And nothing made such Whites angrier than seeing Black people thrive, succeed, and enjoy life, because this threatened their worldview. And this is when lynchings took place. (*""Hang those uppity n*****s!""*)

Imagine an alternate timeline in which the post-Civil-War cleanup had involved the US government incorporating a large new state in the South, designated by law to be run by Blacks for Blacks. Whites who lived there already could stay, but they absolutely could not lord over the Black majority, and any attempts to do so were swiftly and effectively prosecuted. There would be at least a sizable plurality of racist Southern Whites whose righteous indignation over having to accept Blacks as equals, and be a minority amongst them, would be boundless and unquenchable. To this day, that Black state's very existence would be attacked and treated as an abomination that needed undoing, until those filthy N-words could be put in their proper place again, and all was right with the world once more. Because when your tribal pride and sense of supremacy over other tribes is all you've got going for you, oh yeah, you're going to cling to it and fight for it tenaciously.

People reading about this conflict need to understand that Jews have long played that same role of whipping boy, of denigrated and vanquished ""other"", to Muslim Arabs. Poormouthing and mistreating Jews with impunity has long been a valued outlet for catharsis among Muslim Arabs, which finds a fair degree of support in the Qur'an and Hadiths. As painful as life could be, and as cruel and capricious their own leaders could be, Muslim Arabs could, and often did, take solace in the fact that at least they weren't filthy Jews. And seeing Jews in their midst happy and thriving when times were tough for them, was enough to incite murderous rage against them (*'Idbah al-YahÅ«d!*)

Arab Muslims and their sympathizers really don't like me saying this, and will play all kinds of head games and word games with me to make me look and feel bad for saying it. Because it doesn't make them, their culture, and their religion look good in the eyes of the world. But if any lasting resolution to this conflict is possible, it needs to be said and duly understood. Because it's the truth, and it's not going away. This kind of racism, which acts as a weight-bearing pillar in the societies where it occurs, cannot be appeased away or quenched with kindness. It's the same reason why there is nothing peaceful or wholesome a victim of abuse or bullying can do to get his tormentor to treat him better. The abuse is driven by the bully's psychological need to dominate, and take out his frustrations on, someone who can't do anything about it. Anything short of a full-force, no-regret retaliation only encourages this bullying behavior further.

This is why I support Israel in this conflict, and see their relative lack of mercy in retaliating for October 7th as called for. Come what may, it behooves Israel, and the Jewish people worldwide, to show the Muslim Arab world that they are nobody's fool, nobody's whipping boy, and nobody's scapegoat for their own internal problems. The overcrowded, interconnected world that's dawning cannot afford this type of large-scale debasement of one people by another for psychological comfort. If they're to survive at all, Islam and Arab culture need to have a major reckoning, in which they learn to cope with life's pains and struggles without shifting blame onto, and attacking, a hated outside group.

I usually just lurk on Reddit but been wanting to say something on this.   
I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden which is a traditionally quite ""pro-Palestine"" city due to the considerable background of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants, as well as a history of leftist movements in Sweden in general sympathizing with the Palestinian cause under the trope of an anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist struggle. So essentially while I have my view of the conflict, it goes against the opinion of my city, school, and the social circles I hang around. And I don't say it to people irl either unless I trust them fearing they might react in a seriously negative form, hence the other reason to post it here on Reddit.   
So the Gaza war currently ongoing is atrocious, and no one who isn't sick-minded is glorifying the casualties and deaths of thousands of innocents in the Gaza strip. And this is where I have mixed feelings about said ceasefire and the whole Israel bashing. Israel didn't start this campaign because they thought it was amusing or something, similar atrocities happened on the 7th of October where almost 1200 Israelis were killed/kidnapped by Hamas militants. And this is where I see the flaws or inconsistencies of the pro-Palestine side I see, there's the condemnation of what Israel is currently doing. But at least from what I saw there was barely any condemnation of what Hamas did from said pro-Palestine crowds.   
This is kind of infuriating or bizarre to me because the excuses that I was given were either: 1.""Well the Gaza population doesn't represent Hamas"" Obviously not, but neither does the Israeli population represent the Israeli government.   
OR  


2.""Well this wouldn't have happened if Israel didn't....""   
To me is a piss poor argument, because you could rhetorically make the same argument for what Israel is doing rn i.e. ""Well this wouldn't be happening if Hamas didn't..."" etc. Or the idea that 'Extremism breeds extremism"". And by using this logic ""Well if nuh nuh didn't do nuh nuh this wouldn't have..."" Back to almost decades of the conflict. (And I get that you can't discuss this conflict without DEEP historical nuance and understanding but I'm just talking about the Gaza war in the immediate context).  
And so this is where I'm conflicted on the matter. I still maintain the position that I held for years, which is that of the two-state solution.   
But this is impossible because for almost a decade if not longer, only the radicals have had a say on these matters, and this toxicity spreads to rhetoric in the debate in the West.   
Netanyahou's far-right government is not just trampling on Palestine but also endangering Israeli democratic institutions. And then there's the lack of a unified platform for the Palestinian cause in general i.e. Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas being a terrorist organisation that vows the destruction of Israel.  
But in this current affairs, I only see extremists doing the talking and action, so I guess I form my opinion around the extremists. And if there is to be an end to the immediate ongoing conflict, then imo no matter how appalling the casualties for people in the Gaza strip are, Hamas is also responsible for this ongoing horror. And if they continue to exist then they will continue repeating these kind of attacks and Israel will again react and overreact leading to a large number of deaths.   
So the Netanyahu gov. has responsibility for the suffering of people in Gaza rn and for the backpeddling of the two-state solution for almost a decade. In the immediate term, Hamas must cease to exist for everyone's sake as they are an obvious destabilizing factor not just for Israel and Palestine. But the wholeÂ regionÂ too.

It hasn't been confirmed. Israel say their investigation refute this claim. They have taken responsibility for other incidents that aren't any better, see the one that you mentioned about the shooting. Why would they lie about that but confirm and investigate the other one?

 **al-shifa** 

There's proof that Hamas operated from the hospital, they have tunnel under the hospital, the hospital director confirmed it and the US intelligence also told Israel that Hamas has an head quarter in the hospital. You know the hospital like any other target received evacuation notice? That means that Hamas also had time to evacuate.

I felt sick today so I didnt show up to work today, called it off. Had only 4 planned workout sessions with my clients so I said why not, rest is important.

Turns out that 40 minutes ago 2 palestinian workers with working permits stabbed a couple inside a car, stole the car after kicking them out bleeding on the street, and then went on to proceed and run over 17 people all across Ra'anana.

When they got to the street where my studio is located, a cvilian shot and killed them.

2 other innocent people are dead.

I dont know how to continue from here because no one would want to come training with me knowing that it happened. The feeling of security is nonexistant in these situations.

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no?

When I ask people why, I get answers ranging from 'its complicated', 'Israel are oppressors' to 'Palestinians are terrorists'.

But none of these explain why the conflict has persisted for so long. I believe the reason is because several actors want it to continue. It has been designed to never end, it is manufactured to continue. If the conflict is solved, then the Jewish state gains more legitimacy and becomes significantly more difficult to dismantle.

In Islam, the place of the Jew is below that of the Muslim. They are meant to be second-class citizens, defenseless, stateless and subject to additional taxes. Their place is certainly not to be ruling over Islamic land, and certainly not ruling over Muslims.

In 1948 the Jews accepted a partition plan and declared independence, in their charter they invited the Arabs inside the borders to accept full citizenship and rights and join in the nation building exercise. Arab leaders rejected this and went to war. The war produced 700k Palestinian refugees, a tragic event that caused untold pain and trauma to these people, but they are not unique, the same year similar events happened in Pakistan/India and all across the middle east.

If this conflict was about people losing their homes, it would be solved already. Throughout the 20th century many peoples have lost their homes (jews more than anyone), they move on, they resettle and they build a future for their children, the conflict would be solved by now if this was the issue.

If this conflict was about occupation, or settlements then there would have been no war in 1967. Pre 1967, Israel existed inside her borders with no occupation and no settlements. Everyone had citizenship and equal voting rights.

If this conflict was simply about land, then they would have solved it by now, there has been several solutions on the table to share the land, in 1937 the partition plan recommended a very small Jewish state, and the vast majority of the land would have went to the Arabs. The Arabs rejected this, because any sort of a Jewish state was unacceptable.

After the displacement of the Palestinians during the 48 war. Arab states refused to give citizenship to Palestinians because they know if the Palestinians get resettled then the conflict ends, Jordan actually made this mistake in 48, they invaded and annexed the west bank and gave everyone citizenship. They later withdrew it because they knew this was not compatible with a persistent conflict. Eygpt invaded and controlled Gaza in 48, there was no citizenship granted to the Palestinians. There was certainly no talk between Eygpt and Jordan at the time about establishing a Palestinian state. That would of course have ended the conflict. 

All refugees the world over are handled by UNHCR and they get resettled and move on, the Palestinians however are the only refugees handled by UNWRA who do not have a policy of resettling and actually pass the refugee status on to the children of the Palestinians even if they live in a far away land. For example Bella Hadid qualifies as a Palestinians refugee.

The conflict has persisted because the Jewish state has persisted. Its an opposition to the existence of one. If it was for any other reason then the conflict would be solved by now, one of the many peace deals would have been accepted.

This conflict is manufactured, created, encouraged and it will not end as long as the Arabs refuse to accept a Jewish state, BTW, accepting one on paper does not mean they accept it in reality. Eygpt has signed peace deals with Israel, the general public do not accept the 'Zionist entity'.",The reason the Israel/Palestinian conflict persists,0.77,2024-01-16 08:28:54,addition op gaza chance build infrastructure like israel one frickin lake provide water everyone make fresh water gaza building infrastructure rather fortress israel charity called oppression logic israel send nothing let figure strong independent country,conflict unique fact persisted long without solution ask people get answer ranging complicated israel oppressor palestinian terrorist none explain conflict persisted long believe reason several actor want continue designed never end manufactured continue conflict solved jewish state gain legitimacy becomes significantly difficult dismantle islam place jew muslim meant secondclass citizen defenseless stateless subject additional tax place certainly ruling islamic land certainly ruling muslim 1948 jew accepted partition plan declared independence charter invited arab inside border accept full citizenship right join nation building exercise arab leader rejected went war war produced 700k palestinian refugee tragic event caused untold pain trauma people unique year similar event happened pakistanindia across middle east conflict people losing home would solved already throughout 20th century many people lost home jew anyone move resettle build future child conflict would solved issue conflict occupation settlement would war 1967 pre 1967 israel existed inside border occupation settlement everyone citizenship equal voting right conflict simply land would solved several solution table share land 1937 partition plan recommended small jewish state vast majority land would went arab arab rejected sort jewish state unacceptable displacement palestinian 48 war arab state refused give citizenship palestinian know palestinian get resettled conflict end jordan actually made mistake 48 invaded annexed west bank gave everyone citizenship later withdrew knew compatible persistent conflict eygpt invaded controlled gaza 48 citizenship granted palestinian certainly talk eygpt jordan time establishing palestinian state would course ended conflict refugee world handled unhcr get resettled move palestinian however refugee handled unwra policy resettling actually pas refugee status child palestinian even live far away land example bella hadid qualifies palestinian refugee conflict persisted jewish state persisted opposition existence one reason conflict would solved one many peace deal would accepted conflict manufactured created encouraged end long arab refuse accept jewish state btw accepting one paper mean accept reality eygpt signed peace deal israel general public accept zionist entity,I,"Confidence: High | The comment defends Israel by suggesting Gaza had opportunities to build infrastructure and questions why Israel's aid is seen as oppression.

1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from â€œforeignâ€ ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.

They are two liberation movements that physically can't coexist on the same piece of land and they have only led to an endless cycle of violence and oppression. It seems that Israel's plan is simply to continue a military occupation in Gaza and the West Bank and kill anyone who attacks while following every law as closely as possible. I guess the hope is that eventually Palestinians and neighbouring countries will be convinced through strength and domination and the rest of the world will be convinced legally.

Can we ever expect moderate voices to rise to leadership and find some sort of detante? Can the extremism be controlled on both side? Must Gaza and the West Bank remain under military occupation? Religious attachment land seems impossible to overcome. If Jews could return to Israel after 1800 years in exile, you can't expect Palestinians and Muslims to ever give up there dreams of right of return and pan-islamism. The wars/violence unfortunately seem inevitable :(

There is the claim that if the Palestinians had invested all the funds from the donations in building a better life for their people the situation there could have been much better.

For example, they could build bunkers for their citizens instead of a tunnel system for Hamas.

On the other hand, pro-Palestinians claim that the money comes through Israel and Israel would not let them live a good life or build bunkers for civilians.

My question is if Israel is  in control of the money and material that goes into Gaza how is it possible that they built a tunnel system bigger than the tunnel system of New York City?
Where did they get all the weapons?
Was it also under Israeli supervision?
The Israelis told them, well, can you build a system of tunnels to fight us? It's ridiculous.

If Hamas had enough money and material to build tunnels for themselves, they had enough money and material to build shelters for their citizens.

By the way, Israel is not the only one that borders Gaza, it is very convenient to forget that the Egyptian blockade is more severe than the Israeli one.
The Egyptians are bitter rivals of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas is an organization of the Muslim Brotherhood.

I personally think that if there was a good life in Gaza, the aid money would stop coming, and this is very scary for the leaders of Hamas who, as we know, live in Qatar a luxury life because of the donations .

That belief is really what keeps everyone stuck in the perpetual circle of violence. However that belief is a total falsehood:

1. Jews that newly arrived in the region in the first part of last century arrived on land purchased from Ottoman land owners. No-one was kicked from any land for that (google 'first picture tel aviv' as an example);
2. 'Kicking people out of homes' really only happened in the West Bank and only after arabs initiated multiple wars and terrorist attacks against Israel;
3. The 'Nakba' is really just an Arabian war failure that Israel is being blamed for: the Arabs started a war to destroy Israel, recommended local Arabs to flee so that the Israelis could be wiped off the map more easily and with the promise that those people could return to their homes after the war, but subsequently they lost the war and (surprise, surprise) Israel didn't allow the sympathisants of their enemies back in.
4. Millions of Arabs and non-Jews live peacefully in Israel. Which also makes sense since the Israeli declaration of independence amongst others states: ""The State of Israel will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice, and peace; will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race, or sex; will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education, and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions.""  
Palestinians that were living in Israel when Israel was founded and didn't flee for wars that the Arabs started, are still living in Israel and haven't lost homes or home land.

In summary, with the exception of what happens in the West Bank, hardly any Palestinians were kicked out of houses or off of land by Israel. But still, somehow Palestinians and especially pro-Palestinian leftists in the West believe that all Israelis live on land and in houses where the Palestinians were kicked out of.

His crime: after he scored a goal he pointed to a writing on his hand that says ""100 days. 7/10"".
This gesture was intended for mentioning the 100th day since Hamas's murderous attack on Israel, and it's a call for releasing the hostages from captivity.
There are 136 hostages currently in Gaza, old people, children, men and women. Some of them need urgent medical care, some of them are (or at least were) social activists and rooted for peace with the Palestinians, some hold non-israeli citizenship, and Hamas captured all of them all the same.
Hamas is tormenting those people, many of the released hostages testified about the horrible conditions in their captivity, hunger, denial of medical care, sexual abuse, almost no sunlight if at all. Almost all of the hostages that the IDF tried to rescue turned out to be dead. I believe it's safe to say that Hamas's terrorists prefer to kill the Israeli hostages rather than letting the IDF to rescue them.
Some of them won't last for long. Calling for their release is a moral obligation, you don't have to be pro-israel to know that. Just human.
Apparently, mentioning this subject is considered as a a crime in Turkey, and Sagiv Yehezkel's actions were condemned by the national football association, and his team announced that he'll be suspended at best, or fired at worst.

Is calling for their release a shameful act? do someone's freedom is necessarily the denial of others?
Why no one is talking about this?

I usually just lurk on Reddit but been wanting to say something on this.   
I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden which is a traditionally quite ""pro-Palestine"" city due to the considerable background of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants, as well as a history of leftist movements in Sweden in general sympathizing with the Palestinian cause under the trope of an anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist struggle. So essentially while I have my view of the conflict, it goes against the opinion of my city, school, and the social circles I hang around. And I don't say it to people irl either unless I trust them fearing they might react in a seriously negative form, hence the other reason to post it here on Reddit.   
So the Gaza war currently ongoing is atrocious, and no one who isn't sick-minded is glorifying the casualties and deaths of thousands of innocents in the Gaza strip. And this is where I have mixed feelings about said ceasefire and the whole Israel bashing. Israel didn't start this campaign because they thought it was amusing or something, similar atrocities happened on the 7th of October where almost 1200 Israelis were killed/kidnapped by Hamas militants. And this is where I see the flaws or inconsistencies of the pro-Palestine side I see, there's the condemnation of what Israel is currently doing. But at least from what I saw there was barely any condemnation of what Hamas did from said pro-Palestine crowds.   
This is kind of infuriating or bizarre to me because the excuses that I was given were either: 1.""Well the Gaza population doesn't represent Hamas"" Obviously not, but neither does the Israeli population represent the Israeli government.   
OR  


2.""Well this wouldn't have happened if Israel didn't....""   
To me is a piss poor argument, because you could rhetorically make the same argument for what Israel is doing rn i.e. ""Well this wouldn't be happening if Hamas didn't..."" etc. Or the idea that 'Extremism breeds extremism"". And by using this logic ""Well if nuh nuh didn't do nuh nuh this wouldn't have..."" Back to almost decades of the conflict. (And I get that you can't discuss this conflict without DEEP historical nuance and understanding but I'm just talking about the Gaza war in the immediate context).  
And so this is where I'm conflicted on the matter. I still maintain the position that I held for years, which is that of the two-state solution.   
But this is impossible because for almost a decade if not longer, only the radicals have had a say on these matters, and this toxicity spreads to rhetoric in the debate in the West.   
Netanyahou's far-right government is not just trampling on Palestine but also endangering Israeli democratic institutions. And then there's the lack of a unified platform for the Palestinian cause in general i.e. Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas being a terrorist organisation that vows the destruction of Israel.  
But in this current affairs, I only see extremists doing the talking and action, so I guess I form my opinion around the extremists. And if there is to be an end to the immediate ongoing conflict, then imo no matter how appalling the casualties for people in the Gaza strip are, Hamas is also responsible for this ongoing horror. And if they continue to exist then they will continue repeating these kind of attacks and Israel will again react and overreact leading to a large number of deaths.   
So the Netanyahu gov. has responsibility for the suffering of people in Gaza rn and for the backpeddling of the two-state solution for almost a decade. In the immediate term, Hamas must cease to exist for everyone's sake as they are an obvious destabilizing factor not just for Israel and Palestine. But the wholeÂ regionÂ too.

1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from â€œforeignâ€ ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.
3) The residents of todays Israel are born and raised there mostly, their grandparents/great grand parents came from Europe and other Jewish diasporas (africa, syria etc), and their closest ancestors have been living there for 70+ years.

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

I've never seen a conflict bring out so many confidently wrong and ignorant people. It's astounding.

Jews are an *ethnicity* in addition to a religion. It's called an ethnoreligion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoreligious\_group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoreligious_group). Technically, there's no real thing as ""race"", so you're double wrong. Google the ""land of Judaea"". That's the homeland. Cry about it/

""The majority of Jews left to Europe"" No they didn't, but even if they did, it was because they were **kicked out by colonizers...** Now they're taking the land back from the colonizers and you are mad about it? 

The Zionists didn't ""automatically"" kick anyone out. They tried to reach an agreement to split the land fairly. The Arabs disagreed that it was fair. That's fine, they started a war and lost. They have to live with the consequences of that loss. It's called taking responsibility. Have you ever had to do that in your life?

1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from â€œforeignâ€ ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.
3) The residents of todays Israel are born and raised there mostly, their grandparents/great grand parents came from Europe and other Jewish diasporas (africa, syria etc), and their closest ancestors have been living there for 70+ years. Iâ€™m from Hungary (not jewish btw, jusr a regular Hungarian person), but looking at my family tree, I have ancestors from Croatia, Germany, Netherlands etc, I would be quite upset if Anyone told me to â€œgo back to Croatia where you came fromâ€.

Anyway, from the ICCRP directly on the issueing of article 12 - ""The council concluded: 'The wording of article 12, paragraph 4, does not distinguish between nationals and aliens (""no one""). Thus, the persons entitled to exercise this right can be identified only by interpreting the meaning of the phrase ""his own country"". The scope of ""his own country"" is broader than the concept ""country of his nationality"". It is not limited to nationality in a formal sense, that is, nationality acquired at birth or by conferral; it embraces, at the very least, an individual who, because of his or her special ties to or claims in relation to a given country, cannot be considered to be a mere alien. This would be the case, for example, for nationals of a country who have been stripped of their nationality in violation of international law, and of individuals whose country of nationality has been incorporated in or transferred to another national entity, whose nationality is being denied them. The language of article 12, paragraph 4, moreover, permits a broader interpretation that might embrace other categories of long-term residents, including but not limited to stateless persons arbitrarily deprived of the right to acquire the nationality of the country of such residence' furthermore 'Different factors are taken into consideration, and their importance will vary from one case to the next: there is the habitual residence of the individual concerned but also the centre of his interests, his family ties, his participation in public life, attachment shown by him for a given country and inculcated in his children, etc.'Â Thus a ""genuine and effective link"" to one's ""own country"" can be composed of various elements, including language, long-term residence, cultural identity, family ties, etc. The right of return is not restricted to nationality in the formal, orÂ de jure, sense. Nor can it be restricted to permanent or habitual residence. One's ""own country"" implies a broader set of ties and connections that together make up ""a genuine and effective link"" as defined in the Nottebohm case. It allows for those outside their own country to return for the first time, even if they were born elsewhere and would be entering for the first time, so long as they have maintained a ""genuine and effective link"" to the country.""Â

A central issue that seems to crop up very often in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the events of 1947 and 1948. Palestinians call it the Nakba (Arabic for catastrophe), while Israelis call it the war of independence. 

My point here is not to rehash the events of that time period, but rather to point out that it would be better for all involved if everyone could move on from the events of that time period (stop trying to change the past and stop ignoring reality). 

To be clear, this does not mean we should ignore or forget history. There are many lessons to be learned from history, and history is incredibly important to all cultures. Just as I would never expect anyone who is Jewish to forget or forgive the Holocaust, I donâ€™t expect anyone who is Palestinian to do those same things when it comes to the Nakba. 

The main difference between the reactions of those affected by the Holocaust and those affected by the Nakba are that Germany does not have their legitimacy constantly questioned as a result of their actions. The world is not still fighting WWII. While there is a difference between those two situations as the Germans have a long history of atoning for their actions over the past 75 years, the basic premise is the same. In order to have peace people must be able to move on from past trauma and stop fighting the same old fight.

I just feel that there wonâ€™t be peace between Israelis and Palestinians until both groups are able to fully recognize that the other group isnâ€™t going anywhere, and that the people of today are not the same as 75 years ago. I also feel that outside actors continue to perpetuate the conflict by denying the legitimacy of Israel because of the way it was established. The uncomfortable truth is that many other countries became the way they are today in similar ways to Israel, yet no one questions their legitimacy. 

From a pragmatic rather than idealistic standpoint, it is important to recognize that neither the Israelis or Palestinians are going anywhere. So why must we continue to fight the same fight?",At what point do we stop litigating something that happened 75 years ago?,0.7,2024-01-16 02:21:06,seem read article gone decision amendment brought unsure tou leaving purpose anyway iccrp directly issueing article 12 council concluded wording article 12 paragraph 4 distinguish national alien one thus person entitled exercise right identified interpreting meaning phrase country scope country broader concept country nationality limited nationality formal sense nationality acquired birth conferral embrace least individual special tie claim relation given country considered mere alien would case example national country stripped nationality violation international law individual whose country nationality incorporated transferred another national entity whose nationality denied language article 12 paragraph 4 moreover permit broader interpretation might embrace category longterm resident including limited stateless person arbitrarily deprived right acquire nationality country residence furthermore different factor taken consideration importance vary one case next habitual residence individual concerned also centre interest family tie participation public life attachment shown given country inculcated child etc thus genuine effective link one country composed various element including language longterm residence cultural identity family tie etc right return restricted nationality formal de jure sense restricted permanent habitual residence one country implies broader set tie connection together make genuine effective link defined nottebohm case allows outside country return first time even born elsewhere would entering first time long maintained genuine effective link country applied length many country decendants refugee random law applied israel,central issue seems crop often israelipalestinian conflict event 1947 1948 palestinian call nakba arabic catastrophe israeli call war independence point rehash event time period rather point would better involved everyone could move event time period stop trying change past stop ignoring reality clear mean ignore forget history many lesson learned history history incredibly important culture would never expect anyone jewish forget forgive holocaust dont expect anyone palestinian thing come nakba main difference reaction affected holocaust affected nakba germany legitimacy constantly questioned result action world still fighting wwii difference two situation german long history atoning action past 75 year basic premise order peace people must able move past trauma stop fighting old fight feel wont peace israeli palestinian group able fully recognize group isnt going anywhere people today 75 year ago also feel outside actor continue perpetuate conflict denying legitimacy israel way established uncomfortable truth many country became way today similar way israel yet one question legitimacy pragmatic rather idealistic standpoint important recognize neither israeli palestinian going anywhere must continue fight fight,N,"Confidence: Medium | The comment is discussing legal interpretations of an amendment within the ICCRP.

The only vocal opposition seems to be coming from the US and Germany. In my view, the reason for this apparently broad support despite Israeli arguments to the contrary is quite simple. To Israel, this is war. War means innocent people die, but nonetheless this war must be fought to prevent the possibility of another 10/7 attack.

The flip side of this for the world is that war is war, but the circumstances of this particular war preclude any brute force military solution, no matter how valid the *casus belli*. In other words, Israelis want the world to accept the prospect of tens (hundreds?) of thousands of Gazan civilians being killed by bombs or dying of starvation/disease in order for Israel to completely root out Hamas and its affiliates in Gaza.

It should be abundantly clear at this point that such acceptance will **never** materialize. Ever. That cost is simply too high for most.

Most Israelis Iâ€™ve seen almost seem to be living in denial. One the one hand, this is understandable since theyâ€™re reeling from a tragedy and are mainly focused on security and the return of the remaining hostages. In such a mindset, international opinion doesnâ€™t matter, and there isnâ€™t room for any serious contemplation of the consequences of Israelâ€™s intransigence in prosecuting this war as it has so far.

The issue is that while this understandable, itâ€™s still not smart. People donâ€™t seem to grasp the impact of a whole generationâ€™s perception of Israel being almost solely defined by the wanton bloodshed in Gaza. Add in the incessant inflammatory and genocidal rhetoric from the Kahanist club of Ben-Gvir, Smotrich, etc. and anti-Zionists are getting everything they could ever dream of. Israel and Zionism conjure pictures of incessant horror and carnage, rather than Jewish nation-building, democracy, freedom, etc.

When I ask people why, I get answers ranging from 'its complicated', 'Israel are oppressors' to 'Palestinians are terrorists'.

But none of these explain why the conflict has persisted for so long. I believe the reason is because several actors want it to continue. It has been designed to never end, it is manufactured to continue. If the conflict is solved, then the Jewish state gains more legitimacy and becomes significantly more difficult to dismantle.

In Islam, the place of the Jew is below that of the Muslim. They are meant to be second-class citizens, defenseless, stateless and subject to additional taxes. Their place is certainly not to be ruling over Islamic land, and certainly not ruling over Muslims.

In 1948 the Jews accepted a partition plan and declared independence, in their charter they invited the Arabs inside the borders to accept full citizenship and rights and join in the nation building exercise. Arab leaders rejected this and went to war. The war produced 700k Palestinian refugees, a tragic event that caused untold pain and trauma to these people, but they are not unique, the same year similar events happened in Pakistan/India and all across the middle east.

If this conflict was about people losing their homes, it would be solved already. Throughout the 20th century many peoples have lost their homes (jews more than anyone), they move on, they resettle and they build a future for their children, the conflict would be solved by now if this was the issue.

If this conflict was about occupation, or settlements then there would have been no war in 1967. Pre 1967, Israel existed inside her borders with no occupation and no settlements. Everyone had citizenship and equal voting rights.

If this conflict was simply about land, then they would have solved it by now, there has been several solutions on the table to share the land, in 1937 the partition plan recommended a very small Jewish state, and the vast majority of the land would have went to the Arabs. The Arabs rejected this, because any sort of a Jewish state was unacceptable.

After the displacement of the Palestinians during the 48 war. Arab states refused to give citizenship to Palestinians because they know if the Palestinians get resettled then the conflict ends, Jordan actually made this mistake in 48, they invaded and annexed the west bank and gave everyone citizenship. They later withdrew it because they knew this was not compatible with a persistent conflict. Eygpt invaded and controlled Gaza in 48, there was no citizenship granted to the Palestinians. There was certainly no talk between Eygpt and Jordan at the time about establishing a Palestinian state. That would of course have ended the conflict. 

All refugees the world over are handled by UNHCR and they get resettled and move on, the Palestinians however are the only refugees handled by UNWRA who do not have a policy of resettling and actually pass the refugee status on to the children of the Palestinians even if they live in a far away land. For example Bella Hadid qualifies as a Palestinians refugee.

The conflict has persisted because the Jewish state has persisted. Its an opposition to the existence of one. If it was for any other reason then the conflict would be solved by now, one of the many peace deals would have been accepted.

This conflict is manufactured, created, encouraged and it will not end as long as the Arabs refuse to accept a Jewish state, BTW, accepting one on paper does not mean they accept it in reality. Eygpt has signed peace deals with Israel, the general public do not accept the 'Zionist entity'.",The reason the Israel/Palestinian conflict persists,0.77,2024-01-16 08:28:54,conflict lesser islamic minority leadership gained power new country pakistan socialistsecular politician india let partition happen op absolutely correct,conflict unique fact persisted long without solution ask people get answer ranging complicated israel oppressor palestinian terrorist none explain conflict persisted long believe reason several actor want continue designed never end manufactured continue conflict solved jewish state gain legitimacy becomes significantly difficult dismantle islam place jew muslim meant secondclass citizen defenseless stateless subject additional tax place certainly ruling islamic land certainly ruling muslim 1948 jew accepted partition plan declared independence charter invited arab inside border accept full citizenship right join nation building exercise arab leader rejected went war war produced 700k palestinian refugee tragic event caused untold pain trauma people unique year similar event happened pakistanindia across middle east conflict people losing home would solved already throughout 20th century many people lost home jew anyone move resettle build future child conflict would solved issue conflict occupation settlement would war 1967 pre 1967 israel existed inside border occupation settlement everyone citizenship equal voting right conflict simply land would solved several solution table share land 1937 partition plan recommended small jewish state vast majority land would went arab arab rejected sort jewish state unacceptable displacement palestinian 48 war arab state refused give citizenship palestinian know palestinian get resettled conflict end jordan actually made mistake 48 invaded annexed west bank gave everyone citizenship later withdrew knew compatible persistent conflict eygpt invaded controlled gaza 48 citizenship granted palestinian certainly talk eygpt jordan time establishing palestinian state would course ended conflict refugee world handled unhcr get resettled move palestinian however refugee handled unwra policy resettling actually pas refugee status child palestinian even live far away land example bella hadid qualifies palestinian refugee conflict persisted jewish state persisted opposition existence one reason conflict would solved one many peace deal would accepted conflict manufactured created encouraged end long arab refuse accept jewish state btw accepting one paper mean accept reality eygpt signed peace deal israel general public accept zionist entity,N,"Confidence: Medium | The comment agrees with the original post's premise that the conflict is manufactured to continue.

This is extremely telling. Israel is the proving ground. It's where the bullet hits the bone. God either honors the grandiose promises of glory and supremacy He supposedly made to the descendants of Ishmael, or all those promises and prophesies were a bunch of malarkey.

Before the Civil Rights Movement in the USA, American Blacks served an important if deplorable role in the minds of southern American Whites: a permanent underclass, onto which Whites could vent their frustrations without consequence. No matter how hard or unfair life was, a poor White man could (and frequently *did*) take solace in the fact that ""At least I'm not some filthy N-word."" Harassing and mistreating Blacks was a socially sanctioned form of catharsis for many unhappy and unfortunate Whites. And nothing made such Whites angrier than seeing Black people thrive, succeed, and enjoy life, because this threatened their worldview. And this is when lynchings took place. (*""Hang those uppity n*****s!""*)

Imagine an alternate timeline in which the post-Civil-War cleanup had involved the US government incorporating a large new state in the South, designated by law to be run by Blacks for Blacks. Whites who lived there already could stay, but they absolutely could not lord over the Black majority, and any attempts to do so were swiftly and effectively prosecuted. There would be at least a sizable plurality of racist Southern Whites whose righteous indignation over having to accept Blacks as equals, and be a minority amongst them, would be boundless and unquenchable. To this day, that Black state's very existence would be attacked and treated as an abomination that needed undoing, until those filthy N-words could be put in their proper place again, and all was right with the world once more. Because when your tribal pride and sense of supremacy over other tribes is all you've got going for you, oh yeah, you're going to cling to it and fight for it tenaciously.

People reading about this conflict need to understand that Jews have long played that same role of whipping boy, of denigrated and vanquished ""other"", to Muslim Arabs. Poormouthing and mistreating Jews with impunity has long been a valued outlet for catharsis among Muslim Arabs, which finds a fair degree of support in the Qur'an and Hadiths. As painful as life could be, and as cruel and capricious their own leaders could be, Muslim Arabs could, and often did, take solace in the fact that at least they weren't filthy Jews. And seeing Jews in their midst happy and thriving when times were tough for them, was enough to incite murderous rage against them (*'Idbah al-YahÅ«d!*)

Arab Muslims and their sympathizers really don't like me saying this, and will play all kinds of head games and word games with me to make me look and feel bad for saying it. Because it doesn't make them, their culture, and their religion look good in the eyes of the world. But if any lasting resolution to this conflict is possible, it needs to be said and duly understood. Because it's the truth, and it's not going away. This kind of racism, which acts as a weight-bearing pillar in the societies where it occurs, cannot be appeased away or quenched with kindness. It's the same reason why there is nothing peaceful or wholesome a victim of abuse or bullying can do to get his tormentor to treat him better. The abuse is driven by the bully's psychological need to dominate, and take out his frustrations on, someone who can't do anything about it. Anything short of a full-force, no-regret retaliation only encourages this bullying behavior further.

This is why I support Israel in this conflict, and see their relative lack of mercy in retaliating for October 7th as called for. Come what may, it behooves Israel, and the Jewish people worldwide, to show the Muslim Arab world that they are nobody's fool, nobody's whipping boy, and nobody's scapegoat for their own internal problems. The overcrowded, interconnected world that's dawning cannot afford this type of large-scale debasement of one people by another for psychological comfort. If they're to survive at all, Islam and Arab culture need to have a major reckoning, in which they learn to cope with life's pains and struggles without shifting blame onto, and attacking, a hated outside group.

**Why is there no outrage at the current extortion level fees that a Gazan needs to come up with, up to USD$10,000 in cash to leave the strip, per person?**

&gt;A network of brokers, based in Cairo, helping Palestinians leave Gaza has operated around the Rafah border for years. But prices have surged since the start of the war, from $500 for each person.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Guardian has spoken to a number of people who have been told they would have to pay between $5,000 and $10,000 each to leave the strip, with some launching crowdfunding campaigns to raise the money. Others were told they could leave sooner if they paid more.

I believe there is massive evidence of war crimes against civilians but in this sub people deem any civilian death as Hamas fault even without evidence so I'll limit my self to statements and actions by Israeli politicians and IDF soldiers that supposed killing civilians, mass murder, mass destruction of Gaza. These are all easily verifiable and I'll provide links if you ask me
Statements of Israeli officials and major politicians: 

-ministers Ben Gvir and Smotrich supporting mass relocation of Gazans aka ethnic cleansing. Both have called for ""voluntary"" immigration of Gazans 
-Herzog president of israel : â€œIt is an entire nation out there that is responsible, there are no innocent civilians in Gaza â€œIt is not true this rhetoric about civilians not being aware, not involved. Itâ€™s absolutely not true. They could have risen up. They could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup dâ€™etat.â€
So the president of israel is saying civilians are responsible, therefore (even though he didn't say it explicitly) if they die they kinda deserve it 
- Amalek references by Netanyahu. Amalek was an evil nation that was exterminates by the Israelites , according to the bible since they were all evil and against the Israelites God ordered Jews to kill them all including women, children and even their animals. It's naive an dishonest to think this isn't a reference to the entire population of Gaza, the fact Herzog says there are no innocent Gazans further reinforces my claim
Other statements by Israeli Knesset members:

Gaza should be razed and Israelâ€™s rule should be restored to the place. This is our country"".(Moshe Feiglin Likud Knesset member)

This victory should [consist of] two aims: 1. No more Muslim land in the Land of Israel. What they imagine, as if it is Dar al-Islam, will forever be Israeli territory, â€˜the holy landâ€™ [said in Arabic], which belongs to the Israelites â€¦ That is what victory is. And after we make it into Israel land, Gaza should be left as a monument, like Sodom, â€˜nothing sown and nothing growingâ€™ [Deuteronomy 29:23]. And the second â€¦ aim is: full Israeli controlÂ â€¦ Full military and civilian control. Nothing lessâ€ (Amit Halevi Likud Knesset member)

-Erase Gaza. Nothing else will satisfy us â€¦ Do not leave a child there[,] expel anyone who remains there when it ends, so that they wonâ€™t re-establishâ€
Gaza must be burned.â€
(Nissing Vaturi (Likud Knesset member)
-Again Vaturi said :â€œI stand behind my words... It is better to burn down buildings rather than have [Israeli] soldiers harmed. There are no innocents there,â€ he said in a radio interview before calling for the â€œeliminationâ€ of the estimated 100,000 Palestinians left in northern Gaza. â€œI have no mercy for those who are still there. We need to eliminate them,â€
(Nissing Vaturi (Likud Knesset member)
Topple buildings!! Bomb unconsciously!! Stop with this impotence. You have [the] ability. There is wall-to-wall international legitimacy! Flatten Gaza. Without mercy! This time there is no room for mercy (Revital Gotliv Knesset member)

At the moment, one goal: Nakba!
A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 48.
A Nakba in Gaza and a Nakba to anyone who will dare to join!
A Nakba to them, because like then in 1948, the alternative is clearâ€
A Nakba to them, because like then in 1948, the alternative is clearâ€ (Ariel Kallner Knesset member Likud party)

The Israeli operation must turn Hamasâ€™s surprise attack into a Nakba (catastrophe) for Gaza. The IDF must crush Hamas, kill every member of the organisation and exterminate everything related to it. The pattern of surgical operations must be abandoned and we must say goodbye to practices like â€˜knock on the roofâ€™. The residents [of Gaza] have been issued warnings, and now it is the time for cannons, not just aircraftsâ€
(Meir Ben Shabbat former head of the Shinbet and current head of the Misgav Institute)

IDF soldiers behavior:
- IDF soldiers desecrated a mosque in Jebin singing Talmudic songs on the loudspeakers, mocking the Muslim call to prayer
-writing the names of people who criticize Israel on missiles directed at Gaza
- IDF soldiers chanting about wiping of the seed of Amalek, occupying Gaza and that there's is no uninvolved civilians
-Idf soldiers singing about destroying all of Gaza
-Israel's state Tv broadcasting kids singing about how Israelis will annihilate all of Gaza, Israelis will go back to plow ""their"" fields in Gaza and overall glorifications of the war
-Israel's Singer Rinat Bar singing a song wishing Sinwar and Nasrallah death (understandable) along with ALL of Gaza.

&gt;â€œI'll make it simple â€“ open the door! No one is compelling anyone to leave,â€ Gamliel implored the international community. â€œYou cannot disregard the suffering of the Gazans.

**Why is there no outrage at the current extortion level fees that a Gazan needs to come up with, up to USD$10,000 in cash to leave the strip, per person?**

&gt;A network of brokers, based in Cairo, helping Palestinians leave Gaza has operated around the Rafah border for years. But prices have surged since the start of the war, from $500 for each person.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Guardian has spoken to a number of people who have been told they would have to pay between $5,000 and $10,000 each to leave the strip, with some launching crowdfunding campaigns to raise the money. Others were told they could leave sooner if they paid more.  
&gt;  
&gt;Facebook pages that offer news from the Rafah crossing are filled with posts from Palestinians asking for help to get on the list. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/08/palestinians-flee-gaza-rafah-egypt-border-bribes-to-brokers)

1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from â€œforeignâ€ ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.
3) The residents of todays Israel are born and raised there mostly, their grandparents/great grand parents came from Europe and other Jewish diasporas (africa, syria etc), and their closest ancestors have been living there for 70+ years. Iâ€™m from Hungary (not jewish btw, jusr a regular Hungarian person), but looking at my family tree, I have ancestors from Croatia, Germany, Netherlands etc, I would be quite upset if Anyone told me to â€œgo back to Croatia where you came fromâ€.

This is because of one central part about a group.
           A flag is meant to represent something (most the time) like the US with the 50 stars being all the states, and the 13 stripes representing the original 13 colonies, The UK is a mixture of the English, Scottish, and Irish flag, and the Japanese flag is to represent the land of the rising sun since they are technically one of the first to see the rising sun. All these flag mean something. Why did I go on this rant? I did it because the Houthi flag are words in Arabic. These words translate to: 
Allahu Akbar (green)
Death to America (red)
Death to Israel (red)
Curse the Jews (red)

A central issue that seems to crop up very often in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the events of 1947 and 1948. Palestinians call it the Nakba (Arabic for catastrophe), while Israelis call it the war of independence. 

My point here is not to rehash the events of that time period, but rather to point out that it would be better for all involved if everyone could move on from the events of that time period (stop trying to change the past and stop ignoring reality). 

To be clear, this does not mean we should ignore or forget history. There are many lessons to be learned from history, and history is incredibly important to all cultures. Just as I would never expect anyone who is Jewish to forget or forgive the Holocaust, I donâ€™t expect anyone who is Palestinian to do those same things when it comes to the Nakba. 

The main difference between the reactions of those affected by the Holocaust and those affected by the Nakba are that Germany does not have their legitimacy constantly questioned as a result of their actions. The world is not still fighting WWII. While there is a difference between those two situations as the Germans have a long history of atoning for their actions over the past 75 years, the basic premise is the same. In order to have peace people must be able to move on from past trauma and stop fighting the same old fight.

I just feel that there wonâ€™t be peace between Israelis and Palestinians until both groups are able to fully recognize that the other group isnâ€™t going anywhere, and that the people of today are not the same as 75 years ago. I also feel that outside actors continue to perpetuate the conflict by denying the legitimacy of Israel because of the way it was established. The uncomfortable truth is that many other countries became the way they are today in similar ways to Israel, yet no one questions their legitimacy. 

From a pragmatic rather than idealistic standpoint, it is important to recognize that neither the Israelis or Palestinians are going anywhere.

Nope, it is not proof either. It has bunch of arguments in it, some are weak some are solid. For example, Sapir is a horrible witness whose testimony changed several times. 

&gt; Why are you on a sub for civil discussion if you're not willing to admit any of Hamas's wrongdoings?

Hamas's attacks on civilians are unacceptable. I told that several times. 

&gt; Why are you on a sub for civil discussion if you're not willing to admit any of Hamas's wrongdoings?

Maybe you should ask the same question to yourself too. Why are you here if you are against people questioning what Israel says? 

Also, have you condemned Israel as well for killing civilians, and indiscriminately bombing? How about rapes in israeli prisons? Have you ever condemned those?",IsraelPalestine,2024-01-17 16:12:45,198mdbj,samettinho,0.0,1.0,2021-01-02 04:15:36,29822.0,52.0,"Genuine question:

The earlies known record of the israelites besides the bible is the merneptah stele, it is named after merneptah, a pharaoh of egypt that ruled from 1213 BCEâ€” 1203 BCE. The stele has record accounts of merneptah military campaigns to spread egypt into modern day libya, however, the last  lines of the 28 lines stele tells the account of a separate campaign in modern day israel. The lines read as following: 

Plundered is the Canaan with every evil;
Carried off is Asqaluni;
Seized upon is Gezer;
Yanoam is made non-existent;
Israel is laid wasteâ€”its seed is no more;
Kharru has become a widow because of Egypt.



One thing i would also like to mention and how israel is mentioned in the stele. According to my source, when the stele mention the conquest of other empires such as gezer and yanoam, they have a symbol of a throw stick and 3 mountains which means they were established city states, when the stele mentions israel, it shows a symbol is a throw stick + a man and a women over 3 vertical lines. The throw stick means â€œforeignâ€ and the man &amp; the women means â€œpeopleâ€, this shows that the people of israel at the time were not an established city-state but was actually a tribe of people that migrated to the region, from where the migrated from is unknown but it looks like they were in the process of creating a state before the egyptian army came to them. I would also like to mention that when the stele says, â€œ israel is laid waste-its seed is not moreâ€ according to my source, this might mean that that the invasive of the israelite tribes by egypt caused a famine which weaken the tribes and made them not pose a threat to egypt. 



Other sources of israel's existence are the kurkh monoliths, the tel dan stele and the mesha stele. The kurkh monoliths are two assyrian steles that records the rule of Ashurnasirpal II and his son Shalmaneser III, the monoliths were discovered 1861 in what is now modern day Turkey. In the monolith of Shalmaneser lll, there is a battle known as the battle of Qarqar, one of the names mentioned in this battle is Ahaabbu Sirilaaa, which is a reference to Ahab, the 7th king of israel. Although the word â€œisraelâ€ is never mentioned in the stele, scholars bring up that the assyrian and babylonian records refer in there texts as â€œhouse of Omriâ€ Omri was the father of Ahab and was king of israel before Ahab according to the hebrew bible. The Kurkh monoliths are also the oldest documents that mention that arabs.  The mesha stele, also known as the moabite stone, is dates to 840 BCE and was discovered in Dhiban, jordan. To shorten the description, the stele talks about how the canaanite gods had been angered by the people and allowed them to be subjugated by the already established kingdom of israel, after some time, the god of canaan allowed the canaanite king Mesha to defeat the israelites and restore the land of canaan. The Mesha stele historical refers the kingdom of israel as the house of Omri and it also has the earliest records of the israelites god Yahweh. The Mesha stele is regarded as genuine and historical by the majority of biblical archaeologists today. The Tel Dan stele was discovered in Tel Dan, israel. The Tel Dan stele is significant because it is the only non-biblical reference that mentions the house of david. The stele has references of a Individual who killed jehoram of israel, the son of ahab and king of israel after ahab. The writing correlates with the second book of kings in the hebrew bible. 


The first ever record of palestine was in 12 BCE when egypt used the term â€œpelesetâ€ for a neighboring people. It was used a few times buy other civilizations as well. The first time it was as a region was after the romans conquered the region in 6 CE and established the region known as Judaea. After the jewish revolt which was known as the Bar kokhba revolt of 132 CE that failed to overthrow roman rule. The romans renamed the province to syria palestina to humiliate the jewish people by naming the province after there ancient enemy the philistines. Please keep in mind that palestine was a region at the time and would not be a state until 1988. The state of palestine was founded in 1988 and was governed by the palestine liberation movement. Which claimed the west bank and the gaza strip.




Ok lets do the math. The mernephat stele was created in 1208 BCE and is believed to be the earliest record of israel. That would mean that israel is 1,340 years older than palestina, 1,808 years older than islam and 3,191 years older than the state of Palestine. The idea that palestine has been there for centuries and israel colonized it is completely false

My implication of the statement was that most people in Gaza support Hamas and what they stand for. Is ALL their brain peanut sized to not realise they would be facing a massive retaliatory attack?

""Children of darkness"" doesn't literally mean children. It's a figure of speech. The other two quotes are just words and nothing more. Was there any deliberate attempt at eradicating innocents. Did they carpet bomb Gaza? No and no.

Tell me what is the alternative? Not a single person has managed to reply to my question about what Israel could've done instead. If you were the prime minister and your people got brutally massacred and raped, what would you do?

And again don't tell me all palestinians were stupid to not realise what October 7th would mean. Many took Twitter to celebrate. Did they really think Israel wouldn't do anything back. Their situation today and displacement is the direct decision of the support palestinians provided Hamas. I feel sorry for the 20% who didn't support Hamas and caught up in the mess.

**Background: 

I saw an very old time friend on Instagram posting extremely skewed pro Palestine stuff on his stories. I thought I'll have a discussion with him to see and share his views as I disagreed with his post. But all he did was not provide any valid response, and just ended up icing me out. Now I don't really care that he iced me out but it bothers me how insecure all these people with the positions they hold.

FULL DISCLOSURE: This conflict does not affect me or him in any personal way. So i think we could've had a productive discussion.


Why this bothers me?

It is so annoying to see a lot of people's double standards when it comes to victims. Pro Palestinians seems to always forget about October 7th massacre against innocents and kidnapped Jews who are being held as hostages.

And if they did care about innocent people losing lives why do they not post about Syrians, yemenis, uyghurs, rohingya muslims, etc. There are far more injustice and causalities there, but those groups get ignored completely.


**What is my view?

I supported Palestinians initially after seeing the horrific videos of dead people under rubble after Israel started bombing Gaza on October 8th. Out of curiosity I decided to learn about the conflict and TLDR, I don't think what Israel is doing is 'genocide'. They retaliated and they want to make sure this doesn't happen again and the only way to do that is to eliminate Hamas. There will be civilian casualties - it is inevitable.

Another note I realised is that there's a lot of skewed realities and alternative facts shared from the pro Palestinian side. Even though I havent seen pure BS from Israel side, I ignore whatever they say as well. My conclusions are formed purely based on existing facts, like the Hamas charter, their leader going on TV and calling October 7th a success, the Jewish hostages, and sources critical of their own people like Mossab Yousef Hussain, son of Hamas co founder. 

And i mostly ignore the intricacies in history as well because a lot of good faith and bad faith was done on both sides that makes it impossible to conclude anything solid. But history cannot be changed and we should stop clinging onto it for arguments for action caused today or in the future.

**Why this matter to me?

There is a scary rise of violent mobs and riots rising throughout the world supporting these terrorists groups. In the name of being politically liberal and accepting (i identify myself as left btw) there are people getting away with inciting violence and destruction. And if Hamas or Youthis or Hezabollah wins this social media war, all terrorists groups are going to use this as inspiration and rise up. We will have a slow and complete breakdown of the civilised world. And that's a scary thought.

When I ask people why, I get answers ranging from 'its complicated', 'Israel are oppressors' to 'Palestinians are terrorists'.

But none of these explain why the conflict has persisted for so long. I believe the reason is because several actors want it to continue. It has been designed to never end, it is manufactured to continue. If the conflict is solved, then the Jewish state gains more legitimacy and becomes significantly more difficult to dismantle.

In Islam, the place of the Jew is below that of the Muslim. They are meant to be second-class citizens, defenseless, stateless and subject to additional taxes. Their place is certainly not to be ruling over Islamic land, and certainly not ruling over Muslims.

In 1948 the Jews accepted a partition plan and declared independence, in their charter they invited the Arabs inside the borders to accept full citizenship and rights and join in the nation building exercise. Arab leaders rejected this and went to war. The war produced 700k Palestinian refugees, a tragic event that caused untold pain and trauma to these people, but they are not unique, the same year similar events happened in Pakistan/India and all across the middle east.

If this conflict was about people losing their homes, it would be solved already. Throughout the 20th century many peoples have lost their homes (jews more than anyone), they move on, they resettle and they build a future for their children, the conflict would be solved by now if this was the issue.

If this conflict was about occupation, or settlements then there would have been no war in 1967. Pre 1967, Israel existed inside her borders with no occupation and no settlements. Everyone had citizenship and equal voting rights.

If this conflict was simply about land, then they would have solved it by now, there has been several solutions on the table to share the land, in 1937 the partition plan recommended a very small Jewish state, and the vast majority of the land would have went to the Arabs. The Arabs rejected this, because any sort of a Jewish state was unacceptable.

After the displacement of the Palestinians during the 48 war. Arab states refused to give citizenship to Palestinians because they know if the Palestinians get resettled then the conflict ends, Jordan actually made this mistake in 48, they invaded and annexed the west bank and gave everyone citizenship. They later withdrew it because they knew this was not compatible with a persistent conflict. Eygpt invaded and controlled Gaza in 48, there was no citizenship granted to the Palestinians. There was certainly no talk between Eygpt and Jordan at the time about establishing a Palestinian state. That would of course have ended the conflict. 

All refugees the world over are handled by UNHCR and they get resettled and move on, the Palestinians however are the only refugees handled by UNWRA who do not have a policy of resettling and actually pass the refugee status on to the children of the Palestinians even if they live in a far away land. For example Bella Hadid qualifies as a Palestinians refugee.

The conflict has persisted because the Jewish state has persisted. Its an opposition to the existence of one. If it was for any other reason then the conflict would be solved by now, one of the many peace deals would have been accepted.

This conflict is manufactured, created, encouraged and it will not end as long as the Arabs refuse to accept a Jewish state, BTW, accepting one on paper does not mean they accept it in reality. Eygpt has signed peace deals with Israel, the general public do not accept the 'Zionist entity'.",The reason the Israel/Palestinian conflict persists,0.77,2024-01-16 08:28:54,im sure dont find useful conversation honest agreed upon right land vague set loosely agreed upon term even varies culture culture big believer first therefore land think agreed upon clear throughout human history people get control land one strong enough defend tangible clear see agree upon,conflict unique fact persisted long without solution ask people get answer ranging complicated israel oppressor palestinian terrorist none explain conflict persisted long believe reason several actor want continue designed never end manufactured continue conflict solved jewish state gain legitimacy becomes significantly difficult dismantle islam place jew muslim meant secondclass citizen defenseless stateless subject additional tax place certainly ruling islamic land certainly ruling muslim 1948 jew accepted partition plan declared independence charter invited arab inside border accept full citizenship right join nation building exercise arab leader rejected went war war produced 700k palestinian refugee tragic event caused untold pain trauma people unique year similar event happened pakistanindia across middle east conflict people losing home would solved already throughout 20th century many people lost home jew anyone move resettle build future child conflict would solved issue conflict occupation settlement would war 1967 pre 1967 israel existed inside border occupation settlement everyone citizenship equal voting right conflict simply land would solved several solution table share land 1937 partition plan recommended small jewish state vast majority land would went arab arab rejected sort jewish state unacceptable displacement palestinian 48 war arab state refused give citizenship palestinian know palestinian get resettled conflict end jordan actually made mistake 48 invaded annexed west bank gave everyone citizenship later withdrew knew compatible persistent conflict eygpt invaded controlled gaza 48 citizenship granted palestinian certainly talk eygpt jordan time establishing palestinian state would course ended conflict refugee world handled unhcr get resettled move palestinian however refugee handled unwra policy resettling actually pas refugee status child palestinian even live far away land example bella hadid qualifies palestinian refugee conflict persisted jewish state persisted opposition existence one reason conflict would solved one many peace deal would accepted conflict manufactured created encouraged end long arab refuse accept jewish state btw accepting one paper mean accept reality eygpt signed peace deal israel general public accept zionist entity,N,"Confidence: High | The comment expresses skepticism about the concept of 'right to land' based on historical presence and instead emphasizes the ability to defend land as the determining factor for control.

I mean, **The Armenian genocide**. Does that sound like peace in the Middle East to you?

Are you that desperate in trying to convince everyone that Jews and Israel are the source of all problems, to the point that you're willing to completely erase, manipulate and distort history?

I have to say, it's astounding how you completely erase Arab colonialism, a huge and significant part of history in the Middle East as if it never existed.

Let me remind you that Jews were living in the region about a thousand years before the rise of Islam and more than 2500 years before the establishment of modern Arab nations, when Arab armies conquered and colonized the land of Israel in the seventh century, committing genocides against Jewish communities there and forcefully converted many to Islam. The Dome of the Rock was built by Arab conquerors on top of the Jewish temple.

Which gets me to the next point that Jews, to this day, are forbidden from entering their holiest site, the Temple Mount, because the Jordanian Islamic Waqfa still has control over it.

How is it that you can just completely erase the bloody massacres and pograms led by Arab colonizers against Jews in the land of Israel pre 1948?

And are we just gonna completely erase mizrahi Jewish history?


How Jews were considered dhimmi or second class citizens in Arab Muslim countries where Jews, in addition to other minorities, were forced to pay special taxes, suffered from discriminatory legislation, or homes and synagogues were not allowed to be taller than those of the Muslim population.

Does this sound like peace in the Middle East to you?

Are we just going to erase the fact that Arab leaders, like the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who today is considered the father of Palestinian nationalism, personally met with Hitler, persuading Hitler to extend his extermination plans to the Middle East. Even translated hitler's manifesto to Arabic. Are we just going to forget about the anti Semitic laws that were put into place in Arab and Muslim countries, forcing Jews into labor, punishment, and isolation camps.

Jews were slaughtered in public hangings. Their houses were looted, their synagogues were burnt down, while also being subjected to Nazi inspired pograms backed by their governments.

In Iraq, jews were raped, looted, and murdered in a pogram known as the Farhud.

 In 1948, there were 150000 Jews in Iraq today, there are only four left.

Morocco also experienced extremely violent and bloody anti, jewish rise and pogroms, which led to hundreds of thousands of Jews escaping Morocco.

In Egypt, syria and Yemen, jewish owned businesses and Jewish quarters were burnt down, and Jews were denied their citizenship.

Today, there are zero Jews left in Yemen and in Syria.

Almost 1 million Jews, were ethically cleansed from Arab Muslim countries for the sole reason of being Jewish.

Iran, a country that once had one of the largest ancient Jewish communities, is still being occupied by the Islamic Republic, and to this day, which is still committing systematic crimes against Iranians.

Are we just going to erase the crimes against humanity that this terror regime is committing against not only Iranians, but against Israelis, against Palestinians and other through its terror proxies?

Are we just going to erase the dangerous fundamentalism and radical ideology that has destroyed this region in the last 100 years?

I think a little different for the US:

* After the initial invasions, the US wasn't at war with Iraq or Afghanistan (the countries' governments were allied with the US), they were at war with insurgent groups *in* Iraq and Afghanistan.
* The US prioritized visas for Afghans / Iraqis that were in danger because of their role assisting US troops during the US presence in the countries -- not refugees per se so much as political asylum.

Agreed re: the complexity for Israel. No argument that they have a special level of responsibility, at the same time the situation makes Israel itself taking in the refugees much more challenging.

&gt;I donâ€™t understand why the West Bank is not an option btw. It is supposedly occupied and going to be Palestine one day; right? 

I'm not sure if Israel would really object to Gazan refugees being taken housed / given refuge in the West Bank, since it'd likely be in existing population centers or (if in Area C) in purpose-built housing, which would make security relatively easy to care for.

On the other hand, I think the Palestinian Authority would object pretty strenuously, basically on the premise that refugees from Gaza would include a ton of Hamas supporters and potentially Hamas operatives; Fatah is already worried about Hamas taking over the West Bank.",IsraelPalestine,2024-01-17 18:12:51,198r62k,badass_panda,0.0,1.0,2012-11-07 14:45:04,365624.0,0.0,"This is more of just a general question on a one state solution, but hear me out. 

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no? 

Personally I think answering in the negative holds some implications.

What makes descendants of the regional arabs (displaced during the attack on israel perpetrated by other arab nations) so much more entitled than descendants of other displaced groups?

I'm not even trying have a political argument, I feel kind of ... just, freaked out. 

I honestly just wonder, how do you rationalize it if you're anti-Zion?  What's your thought process for figuring out which descendants from which time periods have the most claim to a particular piece of land? 

Tibet has been occupied all these years, and the tibetans are not digging tunnels or baking babies or raping women at music festivals. 

Jews have been displaced as much as anyone.  And we all descend from people who lived miserable lives.  

The word ""slave"" comes from ""slav"" for example, a group of light skinned people who were enslaved from like the 9th to the 17th century or something like that. 

How was the land compromise suggested for israel/palestine so different from the partition of india - lots of people were displaced, lots and lots more over in india to separate hindus and muslims. 

So what is ""liberating palestine""...? (Jews in the region used to be considered palestinian. Now I guess regional Arabs have exclusive claim to the term ""palestinian."")

(and why did no one call for liberating palestine between 1948 and 1967 when it was controlled by egypt and jordan?)   

I live in eastern U.S., places named after displaced tribes.  Who do we give the land back to?  The Iroquois and the Hurons were enemies.  

I guess that's why some anti-Israel people say the Palestinians descend from the canaanites. As if they went to ancestry dot com and the results said, ""You have DNA from the land of canaan ***during the bronze age***.""  

Why should anyone have to argue about displacement of regional arabs in the war in 1948?  Jews were displaced and expelled from lots of Arab nations at that same time period.  So what are we even talking about? 

The Arab world wants the right-of-return for regional Arabs but... what about giving Jews the right to return and pray at the Temple Mount?  

There is no land in the world that has not been contested and stolen over and over and over.

On the one hand, some people in the Israeli government, e.g. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, are repeatedly calling for Palestinians to leave Gaza, like go to Egypt.

On the other, within 24 hours on October 10, Israel military carried out three air strikes on the Rafah border. ""As a result, the border and its surrounding area was left in tatters, and roads were impossible to drive on"" and ""the border crossing was essentially inoperable"".([https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20231103-the-gaza-egypt-rafah-crossing-explained-it-is-not-a-normal-border](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20231103-the-gaza-egypt-rafah-crossing-explained-it-is-not-a-normal-border))

So, it appears that different ministries within the government are not in agreement: to get the Palestinians to leave or to prevent them from leaving.

Energy Minister Israel Katz, however, is quite clear about what he wants: ""We will win.

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no?

1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from â€œforeignâ€ ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.

The lengths people go to in order to excuse over 75 years of choices that got them where they are, excusing any responsibility for their actions, presenting them as perpetual victims, is wild. When did racism of low expectations become the norm. This kind of stuff is feeding a Western savior fantasy and almost voyeurism as well at this point. 

Gaza is a hostile country run by a hostile terrorist organization hellbent on the destruction of Israel. Diplomacy of Western countries is reduced to negotiating with the most progressive terrorist organization sometimes. Iâ€™ve read literal articles since 10/7 describing how we shouldnâ€™t compare Hamas to ISIS because they are far more progressive as they arenâ€™t â€˜sectarianâ€™ and are willing to coordinate across Islamic religious boundaries. People are that desperate. 

Look at the relationship Israel has with the PA or how Biden removed the Houthi from the terrorist list hoping to legitimize them and increase the likelihood of a peaceful outcome. This does not change the fact that the Houthi are violent militant slavers who are responsible for hundreds of thousands dead. Anyone who believes the thesis that Israel is responsible for Islamic extremism is sleeping. That if itâ€™s wiped off the map the state that replaces it wonâ€™t suffer from human rights violations and atrocities under a terror regime. Time to wake up. 

Most people, including myself, do not support the current Israeli government but also the expectations are insane:

- Diplomatic measures? Fail
- Destroy the terrorists before they destroy you? Fail

Itâ€™s an impossible position that keyboard warriors all over the world donâ€™t seem to grasp and this video is pandering to.

There is so much biased, oversimplified and incorrect information in this video, and I literally do not have enough time in life. But when you hear things like â€˜Jewish European immigrantsâ€™ and â€˜native Palestinian Arabsâ€™ to describe the demographics of the British Mandate of Palestine it should really give you pause. 

Before the 20th century, modern nation states did not exist in the region. The concept of a distinct Palestinian people did not exist. Arabs in the region were united under a common Arab nationalist ideology and would not have identified themselves as people identify them now. Jewish people in the region were more likely to refer to themselves as Palestinian than Arabs, and not as a nationality. The region was diverse, including Jews who had lived there for thousands of years, Bedouins, Druze, etc.

This is a video made by YouTube creator Johnny Harris explaining the divide-and-conqueror strategy used by the Israeli far right to derail any prospect of a Palestinian state. He shows documents and even a recording of Netanyahu explaining his strategy to keep expanding into the West Bank. Netanyahu and the Israeli far right had been dead set on derailing peace going all the way back to the Oslo Accords fanning the flames of hate that led to Yitzhak Rabin's assassination.

Going back to the election of Hamas he points out how many within the Israeli government were actually to see Hamas put in power because it gave them the ability to divide the Palestinian movement and that they can treat Gaza like a hostile country. It also gives the Israeli people a boogie man to be afraid of to sabotage any appetite for peace hence why the government covertly supported them.

When I ask people why, I get answers ranging from 'its complicated', 'Israel are oppressors' to 'Palestinians are terrorists'.

But none of these explain why the conflict has persisted for so long. I believe the reason is because several actors want it to continue. It has been designed to never end, it is manufactured to continue. If the conflict is solved, then the Jewish state gains more legitimacy and becomes significantly more difficult to dismantle.

In Islam, the place of the Jew is below that of the Muslim. They are meant to be second-class citizens, defenseless, stateless and subject to additional taxes. Their place is certainly not to be ruling over Islamic land, and certainly not ruling over Muslims.

In 1948 the Jews accepted a partition plan and declared independence, in their charter they invited the Arabs inside the borders to accept full citizenship and rights and join in the nation building exercise. Arab leaders rejected this and went to war. The war produced 700k Palestinian refugees, a tragic event that caused untold pain and trauma to these people, but they are not unique, the same year similar events happened in Pakistan/India and all across the middle east.

If this conflict was about people losing their homes, it would be solved already. Throughout the 20th century many peoples have lost their homes (jews more than anyone), they move on, they resettle and they build a future for their children, the conflict would be solved by now if this was the issue.

If this conflict was about occupation, or settlements then there would have been no war in 1967. Pre 1967, Israel existed inside her borders with no occupation and no settlements. Everyone had citizenship and equal voting rights.

If this conflict was simply about land, then they would have solved it by now, there has been several solutions on the table to share the land, in 1937 the partition plan recommended a very small Jewish state, and the vast majority of the land would have went to the Arabs. The Arabs rejected this, because any sort of a Jewish state was unacceptable.

After the displacement of the Palestinians during the 48 war. Arab states refused to give citizenship to Palestinians because they know if the Palestinians get resettled then the conflict ends, Jordan actually made this mistake in 48, they invaded and annexed the west bank and gave everyone citizenship. They later withdrew it because they knew this was not compatible with a persistent conflict. Eygpt invaded and controlled Gaza in 48, there was no citizenship granted to the Palestinians. There was certainly no talk between Eygpt and Jordan at the time about establishing a Palestinian state. That would of course have ended the conflict. 

All refugees the world over are handled by UNHCR and they get resettled and move on, the Palestinians however are the only refugees handled by UNWRA who do not have a policy of resettling and actually pass the refugee status on to the children of the Palestinians even if they live in a far away land. For example Bella Hadid qualifies as a Palestinians refugee.

The conflict has persisted because the Jewish state has persisted. Its an opposition to the existence of one. If it was for any other reason then the conflict would be solved by now, one of the many peace deals would have been accepted.

This conflict is manufactured, created, encouraged and it will not end as long as the Arabs refuse to accept a Jewish state, BTW, accepting one on paper does not mean they accept it in reality. Eygpt has signed peace deals with Israel, the general public do not accept the 'Zionist entity'.",The reason the Israel/Palestinian conflict persists,0.77,2024-01-16 08:28:54,colonialism yes,conflict unique fact persisted long without solution ask people get answer ranging complicated israel oppressor palestinian terrorist none explain conflict persisted long believe reason several actor want continue designed never end manufactured continue conflict solved jewish state gain legitimacy becomes significantly difficult dismantle islam place jew muslim meant secondclass citizen defenseless stateless subject additional tax place certainly ruling islamic land certainly ruling muslim 1948 jew accepted partition plan declared independence charter invited arab inside border accept full citizenship right join nation building exercise arab leader rejected went war war produced 700k palestinian refugee tragic event caused untold pain trauma people unique year similar event happened pakistanindia across middle east conflict people losing home would solved already throughout 20th century many people lost home jew anyone move resettle build future child conflict would solved issue conflict occupation settlement would war 1967 pre 1967 israel existed inside border occupation settlement everyone citizenship equal voting right conflict simply land would solved several solution table share land 1937 partition plan recommended small jewish state vast majority land would went arab arab rejected sort jewish state unacceptable displacement palestinian 48 war arab state refused give citizenship palestinian know palestinian get resettled conflict end jordan actually made mistake 48 invaded annexed west bank gave everyone citizenship later withdrew knew compatible persistent conflict eygpt invaded controlled gaza 48 citizenship granted palestinian certainly talk eygpt jordan time establishing palestinian state would course ended conflict refugee world handled unhcr get resettled move palestinian however refugee handled unwra policy resettling actually pas refugee status child palestinian even live far away land example bella hadid qualifies palestinian refugee conflict persisted jewish state persisted opposition existence one reason conflict would solved one many peace deal would accepted conflict manufactured created encouraged end long arab refuse accept jewish state btw accepting one paper mean accept reality eygpt signed peace deal israel general public accept zionist entity,P,"Confidence: High | The comment 'It’s colonialism, so yes.' directly supports a Palestinian perspective by framing the conflict as colonialism, which is a common criticism of Israeli actions and policies.",27,0.541,0.411,0.589,0.0,positive,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.044636376,0.017845914,0.002708435,0.017766917,0.008065036,0.012262905

I believe there is massive evidence of war crimes against civilians but in this sub people deem any civilian death as Hamas fault even without evidence so I'll limit my self to statements and actions by Israeli politicians and IDF soldiers that supposed killing civilians, mass murder, mass destruction of Gaza. These are all easily verifiable and I'll provide links if you ask me
Statements of Israeli officials and major politicians: 

-ministers Ben Gvir and Smotrich supporting mass relocation of Gazans aka ethnic cleansing. Both have called for ""voluntary"" immigration of Gazans 
-Herzog president of israel : â€œIt is an entire nation out there that is responsible, there are no innocent civilians in Gaza â€œIt is not true this rhetoric about civilians not being aware, not involved. Itâ€™s absolutely not true. They could have risen up. They could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup dâ€™etat.â€
So the president of israel is saying civilians are responsible, therefore (even though he didn't say it explicitly) if they die they kinda deserve it 
- Amalek references by Netanyahu. Amalek was an evil nation that was exterminates by the Israelites , according to the bible since they were all evil and against the Israelites God ordered Jews to kill them all including women, children and even their animals. It's naive an dishonest to think this isn't a reference to the entire population of Gaza, the fact Herzog says there are no innocent Gazans further reinforces my claim
Other statements by Israeli Knesset members:

Gaza should be razed and Israelâ€™s rule should be restored to the place. This is our country"".(Moshe Feiglin Likud Knesset member)

This victory should [consist of] two aims: 1. No more Muslim land in the Land of Israel. What they imagine, as if it is Dar al-Islam, will forever be Israeli territory, â€˜the holy landâ€™ [said in Arabic], which belongs to the Israelites â€¦ That is what victory is. And after we make it into Israel land, Gaza should be left as a monument, like Sodom, â€˜nothing sown and nothing growingâ€™ [Deuteronomy 29:23]. And the second â€¦ aim is: full Israeli controlÂ â€¦ Full military and civilian control. Nothing lessâ€ (Amit Halevi Likud Knesset member)

-Erase Gaza. Nothing else will satisfy us â€¦ Do not leave a child there[,] expel anyone who remains there when it ends, so that they wonâ€™t re-establishâ€
Gaza must be burned.â€
(Nissing Vaturi (Likud Knesset member)
-Again Vaturi said :â€œI stand behind my words... It is better to burn down buildings rather than have [Israeli] soldiers harmed. There are no innocents there,â€ he said in a radio interview before calling for the â€œeliminationâ€ of the estimated 100,000 Palestinians left in northern Gaza. â€œI have no mercy for those who are still there. We need to eliminate them,â€
(Nissing Vaturi (Likud Knesset member)
Topple buildings!! Bomb unconsciously!! Stop with this impotence. You have [the] ability. There is wall-to-wall international legitimacy! Flatten Gaza. Without mercy! This time there is no room for mercy (Revital Gotliv Knesset member)

At the moment, one goal: Nakba!
A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 48.
A Nakba in Gaza and a Nakba to anyone who will dare to join!
A Nakba to them, because like then in 1948, the alternative is clearâ€
A Nakba to them, because like then in 1948, the alternative is clearâ€ (Ariel Kallner Knesset member Likud party)

The Israeli operation must turn Hamasâ€™s surprise attack into a Nakba (catastrophe) for Gaza. The IDF must crush Hamas, kill every member of the organisation and exterminate everything related to it. The pattern of surgical operations must be abandoned and we must say goodbye to practices like â€˜knock on the roofâ€™. The residents [of Gaza] have been issued warnings, and now it is the time for cannons, not just aircraftsâ€
(Meir Ben Shabbat former head of the Shinbet and current head of the Misgav Institute)

IDF soldiers behavior:
- IDF soldiers desecrated a mosque in Jebin singing Talmudic songs on the loudspeakers, mocking the Muslim call to prayer
-writing the names of people who criticize Israel on missiles directed at Gaza
- IDF soldiers chanting about wiping of the seed of Amalek, occupying Gaza and that there's is no uninvolved civilians
-Idf soldiers singing about destroying all of Gaza
-Israel's state Tv broadcasting kids singing about how Israelis will annihilate all of Gaza, Israelis will go back to plow ""their"" fields in Gaza and overall glorifications of the war

This is a video made by YouTube creator Johnny Harris explaining the divide-and-conqueror strategy used by the Israeli far right to derail any prospect of a Palestinian state. He shows documents and even a recording of Netanyahu explaining his strategy to keep expanding into the West Bank. Netanyahu and the Israeli far right had been dead set on derailing peace going all the way back to the Oslo Accords fanning the flames of hate that led to Yitzhak Rabin's assassination.

Going back to the election of Hamas he points out how many within the Israeli government were actually to see Hamas put in power because it gave them the ability to divide the Palestinian movement and that they can treat Gaza like a hostile country. It also gives the Israeli people a boogie man to be afraid of to sabotage any appetite for peace hence why the government covertly supported them. While supporting this violent status quo the Israeli far right could keep carving up the West Bank and slowly annexing the territory while making the lives of Palestinian people unbearable. For a while, this status quo or ""One State Reality"" seemed to work, until October 7th.

I know I'm gonna get accused of sympathizing with Hamas so I'm gonna put it out there that what happened on October 7th was squarely the fault of Hamas and its leaders but as the video points out Hamas was allowed to exist and stay in power because it served a political purpose for the Israeli government, they knew this was dangerous and put people at risk but Netanyahu and the Israeli far right kept this strategy up because it served their goal of driving out the Palestinian population and annexing the land.",Proof that Netanyahu and the Israeli far right used Hamas to divide and conquer Palestinian territor,0.46,2024-01-17 14:24:01,say said anything interest watching video anymore essence government give money group way slow control one entity probably happens politics time france fat right created left undermine moderate right dont like bibi even le people working around try find fault look thing jew wrong facing radicalized group celebrated atrocity thanks reminds grandfather camp surviving whole thing cousin religious told holocaust happened didnt pray enough needle say grandpa cut life uncle moved jerusalem soon understand try say even kernel truth inside like digging tomato feces thanks,video made youtube creator johnny harris explaining divideandconqueror strategy used israeli far right derail prospect palestinian state show document even recording netanyahu explaining strategy keep expanding west bank netanyahu israeli far right dead set derailing peace going way back oslo accord fanning flame hate led yitzhak rabins assassination going back election hamas point many within israeli government actually see hamas put power gave ability divide palestinian movement treat gaza like hostile country also give israeli people boogie man afraid sabotage appetite peace hence government covertly supported supporting violent status quo israeli far right could keep carving west bank slowly annexing territory making life palestinian people unbearable status quo one state reality seemed work october 7th know im gon na get accused sympathizing hamas im gon na put happened october 7th squarely fault hamas leader video point hamas allowed exist stay power served political purpose israeli government knew dangerous put people risk netanyahu israeli far right kept strategy served goal driving palestinian population annexing land,P,"Confidence: High | The comment explicitly states 'I don’t like bibi and even less all the people working around him,' and discusses the strategy of the 'Israeli far right' in a critical manner, aligning with a pro-Palestinian perspective.",1015,0.3903,0.103,0.802,0.095,positive,-0.0284391534391534,0.4377645502645503,neutral,0.37751234,0.19770569,0.023505108,0.3817989,0.11922921,0.25404143

I'm just shocked that this hasn't been part of the discussion at all, to be honest.
  

  
The following information is pulled directly from the report.
  

  
During arrest 42% of Children were injured, including gunshot wounds and broken bones, and 65% of children were arrested during the night mostly between midnight and dawn. Half of all arrests took place in the children's homes.
  

  
The majority of children experienced appalling levels of physical and emotional abuse, including being beaten (86%), being threatened with harm (70%), and being hit with sticks or guns (60%).
  

  
Some children reported violence and abuse of a sexual nature, including being hit or touched in the genitals and 69% reported being strip searched.
  

  
60% of children experienced solidarity confinement with the length of time varying from one 1 day to as long as 48 days. 
  

  
Children were denied access to basic services, 70% said they suffered from hunger and 68% said they didn't receive any healthcare.
  

  
Once again, this report was published on the 10th of **July 2023**. It's harrowing reading these children's accounts. Children being prosecuted in military courts, and subjected to dehumanizing practices is sickening and makes my blood boil.


  
I know that during a war, people will often handwave away deeds committed by 'their side' as 'uncomfortable but necessary', but this is never the right course of action, and as long as people make excuses for those that commit heinous deeds ""We'll deal with it in the future"", ""I don't like it, but they're the enemy', then horrible people will continue to hurt others for generations to come.

6552,ki68lz0,1.0,"..Sadly , King  , like most Americans around the time  before the PLO's rise in the 70s    :  simply didn't have Palestinians in the picture .

If Palestinians were considered at all  :   they were no more than ""refugees""   ,  and for the ones more informed  in 1950-1967 about Middle Eastern affairs   : they were just    radical  Vanilla-Arabist ,  or Pro-Nasser  residents  who cause  problems in their host states .

The problem in Palestine  was  known   when he died  in 1968  as the  ""Arab-Israeli conflict""  :  it was some kind of  a petty  a territorial dispute between  a single state   that's despised by its neighbors solely due to its dominant ethnicity   , and neighboring states   who were swinging in the Pro-West and Pro-East  pendulum  of the  the  Cold War  .

Palestinians were not part of these events in the Middle East  in their own  name    since the destruction of their society in 1948  .

Even during the  Mandate  when Palestinians were still independent , and spoke in their own  name  as the Arabic-speaking people of the land  and its natives  :  many of  the International audience  adopted  Israeli-propaganda :

Either that Palestinian Arabs were not a nation   , or if they were  : they were part of a pre-existing ancient  so-called ""Arab nation""  (Which they all knew , or chose to ignore : was just a stage of  a  dick-measuring Public relations contest between heads of states , rather than an actual people with a common political identity  and national allegiance covering an area of  roughly like the US's Mainland  .)   .

Both ideas were used to deny Palestinian national and political rights  by questioning their  nationhood  and individuality   .

These views were around  until the very last moment  , when the Mandate ended .

It would take 16  years until Palestinians reconstituted themselves as a  political entity in the Middle East \*    .   Even  then in 1964  :  the PLO was largely an Egyptian proxy   , and wasn't an actual independent  Palestinian-Arab nationalist  organization until Fatah took over in the late 1960s .

\*(Gaza's ""All-Palestine"" Government was a farce . It was a public relations stunt by the Arab League to counter Abdullah's I  annexation of ""Arab Palestine""  , later known as the West Bank .  Aref Al-Aref in one of the volumes of his work ,   ""Al-Nakba""  , claimed he saw the remains of this government   being a kitchen in some old officer club in Cairo.. It's so pitiful . )

&amp;#x200B;

Indeed : it's a  shame  he died without ever hearing about  Palestinians and their story .

...I think had King lived longer at least a couple of years  after the Assassination of Robert Kennedy  (whose Assassin was a Palestinian )    :   he might have expressed some sympathy towards them   , and reconsidered  whenever Israeli-Jews truly deserve to be viewed  in the same vein as other oppressed  people under suffering   , or that the Palestinians were merely refugees with no political rights to even a portion of their homeland  (assuming  he even heard of them  in his life ).

When I ask people why, I get answers ranging from 'its complicated', 'Israel are oppressors' to 'Palestinians are terrorists'.

But none of these explain why the conflict has persisted for so long. I believe the reason is because several actors want it to continue. It has been designed to never end, it is manufactured to continue. If the conflict is solved, then the Jewish state gains more legitimacy and becomes significantly more difficult to dismantle.

In Islam, the place of the Jew is below that of the Muslim. They are meant to be second-class citizens, defenseless, stateless and subject to additional taxes. Their place is certainly not to be ruling over Islamic land, and certainly not ruling over Muslims.

In 1948 the Jews accepted a partition plan and declared independence, in their charter they invited the Arabs inside the borders to accept full citizenship and rights and join in the nation building exercise. Arab leaders rejected this and went to war. The war produced 700k Palestinian refugees, a tragic event that caused untold pain and trauma to these people, but they are not unique, the same year similar events happened in Pakistan/India and all across the middle east.

If this conflict was about people losing their homes, it would be solved already. Throughout the 20th century many peoples have lost their homes (jews more than anyone), they move on, they resettle and they build a future for their children, the conflict would be solved by now if this was the issue.

If this conflict was about occupation, or settlements then there would have been no war in 1967. Pre 1967, Israel existed inside her borders with no occupation and no settlements. Everyone had citizenship and equal voting rights.

If this conflict was simply about land, then they would have solved it by now, there has been several solutions on the table to share the land, in 1937 the partition plan recommended a very small Jewish state, and the vast majority of the land would have went to the Arabs. The Arabs rejected this, because any sort of a Jewish state was unacceptable.

After the displacement of the Palestinians during the 48 war. Arab states refused to give citizenship to Palestinians because they know if the Palestinians get resettled then the conflict ends, Jordan actually made this mistake in 48, they invaded and annexed the west bank and gave everyone citizenship. They later withdrew it because they knew this was not compatible with a persistent conflict. Eygpt invaded and controlled Gaza in 48, there was no citizenship granted to the Palestinians. There was certainly no talk between Eygpt and Jordan at the time about establishing a Palestinian state. That would of course have ended the conflict. 

All refugees the world over are handled by UNHCR and they get resettled and move on, the Palestinians however are the only refugees handled by UNWRA who do not have a policy of resettling and actually pass the refugee status on to the children of the Palestinians even if they live in a far away land. For example Bella Hadid qualifies as a Palestinians refugee.

The conflict has persisted because the Jewish state has persisted. Its an opposition to the existence of one. If it was for any other reason then the conflict would be solved by now, one of the many peace deals would have been accepted.

This conflict is manufactured, created, encouraged and it will not end as long as the Arabs refuse to accept a Jewish state, BTW, accepting one on paper does not mean they accept it in reality. Eygpt has signed peace deals with Israel, the general public do not accept the 'Zionist entity'.",The reason the Israel/Palestinian conflict persists,0.77,2024-01-16 08:28:54,religion always influence cultural dynamic religion thats like saying sugar influence cake far palestinian go main contention resisting violent dispossession suffering rather resisting jewish cant believe second gone 75 year religion jew muslim around long time never bad,conflict unique fact persisted long without solution ask people get answer ranging complicated israel oppressor palestinian terrorist none explain conflict persisted long believe reason several actor want continue designed never end manufactured continue conflict solved jewish state gain legitimacy becomes significantly difficult dismantle islam place jew muslim meant secondclass citizen defenseless stateless subject additional tax place certainly ruling islamic land certainly ruling muslim 1948 jew accepted partition plan declared independence charter invited arab inside border accept full citizenship right join nation building exercise arab leader rejected went war war produced 700k palestinian refugee tragic event caused untold pain trauma people unique year similar event happened pakistanindia across middle east conflict people losing home would solved already throughout 20th century many people lost home jew anyone move resettle build future child conflict would solved issue conflict occupation settlement would war 1967 pre 1967 israel existed inside border occupation settlement everyone citizenship equal voting right conflict simply land would solved several solution table share land 1937 partition plan recommended small jewish state vast majority land would went arab arab rejected sort jewish state unacceptable displacement palestinian 48 war arab state refused give citizenship palestinian know palestinian get resettled conflict end jordan actually made mistake 48 invaded annexed west bank gave everyone citizenship later withdrew knew compatible persistent conflict eygpt invaded controlled gaza 48 citizenship granted palestinian certainly talk eygpt jordan time establishing palestinian state would course ended conflict refugee world handled unhcr get resettled move palestinian however refugee handled unwra policy resettling actually pas refugee status child palestinian even live far away land example bella hadid qualifies palestinian refugee conflict persisted jewish state persisted opposition existence one reason conflict would solved one many peace deal would accepted conflict manufactured created encouraged end long arab refuse accept jewish state btw accepting one paper mean accept reality eygpt signed peace deal israel general public accept zionist entity,P,"Confidence: Medium | The comment argues that the conflict's persistence is not due to religion but rather because Palestinians are 'resisting the violent dispossession that they are suffering'.

i just think hamas at this point is not just a group of people, but an ideology that takes many different names in the form of extremist groups that was created from the horrible mistreatment of palestinians for decades. 

itâ€™s sad to say but look at whatâ€™s going on now and imagine all the kids who survive this.. do you think they are going to be so kind to the people who did this to them in their eyes? itâ€™s a horrible cycle of anger, pain, and revenge that i fear wonâ€™t ever end until they are free from occupation.

I usually just lurk on Reddit but been wanting to say something on this.   
I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden which is a traditionally quite ""pro-Palestine"" city due to the considerable background of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants, as well as a history of leftist movements in Sweden in general sympathizing with the Palestinian cause under the trope of an anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist struggle. So essentially while I have my view of the conflict, it goes against the opinion of my city, school, and the social circles I hang around. And I don't say it to people irl either unless I trust them fearing they might react in a seriously negative form, hence the other reason to post it here on Reddit.   
So the Gaza war currently ongoing is atrocious, and no one who isn't sick-minded is glorifying the casualties and deaths of thousands of innocents in the Gaza strip. And this is where I have mixed feelings about said ceasefire and the whole Israel bashing. Israel didn't start this campaign because they thought it was amusing or something, similar atrocities happened on the 7th of October where almost 1200 Israelis were killed/kidnapped by Hamas militants. And this is where I see the flaws or inconsistencies of the pro-Palestine side I see, there's the condemnation of what Israel is currently doing. But at least from what I saw there was barely any condemnation of what Hamas did from said pro-Palestine crowds.   
This is kind of infuriating or bizarre to me because the excuses that I was given were either: 1.""Well the Gaza population doesn't represent Hamas"" Obviously not, but neither does the Israeli population represent the Israeli government.   
OR  


2.""Well this wouldn't have happened if Israel didn't....""   
To me is a piss poor argument, because you could rhetorically make the same argument for what Israel is doing rn i.e. ""Well this wouldn't be happening if Hamas didn't..."" etc. Or the idea that 'Extremism breeds extremism"". And by using this logic ""Well if nuh nuh didn't do nuh nuh this wouldn't have..."" Back to almost decades of the conflict. (And I get that you can't discuss this conflict without DEEP historical nuance and understanding but I'm just talking about the Gaza war in the immediate context).  
And so this is where I'm conflicted on the matter. I still maintain the position that I held for years, which is that of the two-state solution.   
But this is impossible because for almost a decade if not longer, only the radicals have had a say on these matters, and this toxicity spreads to rhetoric in the debate in the West.   
Netanyahou's far-right government is not just trampling on Palestine but also endangering Israeli democratic institutions. And then there's the lack of a unified platform for the Palestinian cause in general i.e. Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas being a terrorist organisation that vows the destruction of Israel.  
But in this current affairs, I only see extremists doing the talking and action, so I guess I form my opinion around the extremists. And if there is to be an end to the immediate ongoing conflict, then imo no matter how appalling the casualties for people in the Gaza strip are, Hamas is also responsible for this ongoing horror. And if they continue to exist then they will continue repeating these kind of attacks and Israel will again react and overreact leading to a large number of deaths.   
So the Netanyahu gov. has responsibility for the suffering of people in Gaza rn and for the backpeddling of the two-state solution for almost a decade. In the immediate term, Hamas must cease to exist for everyone's sake as they are an obvious destabilizing factor not just for Israel and Palestine. But the wholeÂ regionÂ too.

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces? Egypt charges them 10k usd for travel visas, and we all can admit that this is kinda gross. So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no?

A central issue that seems to crop up very often in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the events of 1947 and 1948. Palestinians call it the Nakba (Arabic for catastrophe), while Israelis call it the war of independence. 

My point here is not to rehash the events of that time period, but rather to point out that it would be better for all involved if everyone could move on from the events of that time period (stop trying to change the past and stop ignoring reality). 

To be clear, this does not mean we should ignore or forget history. There are many lessons to be learned from history, and history is incredibly important to all cultures. Just as I would never expect anyone who is Jewish to forget or forgive the Holocaust, I donâ€™t expect anyone who is Palestinian to do those same things when it comes to the Nakba. 

The main difference between the reactions of those affected by the Holocaust and those affected by the Nakba are that Germany does not have their legitimacy constantly questioned as a result of their actions. The world is not still fighting WWII. While there is a difference between those two situations as the Germans have a long history of atoning for their actions over the past 75 years, the basic premise is the same. In order to have peace people must be able to move on from past trauma and stop fighting the same old fight.

I just feel that there wonâ€™t be peace between Israelis and Palestinians until both groups are able to fully recognize that the other group isnâ€™t going anywhere, and that the people of today are not the same as 75 years ago. I also feel that outside actors continue to perpetuate the conflict by denying the legitimacy of Israel because of the way it was established. The uncomfortable truth is that many other countries became the way they are today in similar ways to Israel, yet no one questions their legitimacy. 

From a pragmatic rather than idealistic standpoint, it is important to recognize that neither the Israelis or Palestinians are going anywhere. So why must we continue to fight the same fight?",At what point do we stop litigating something that happened 75 years ago?,0.7,2024-01-16 02:21:06,child refugee refugee well un writes gtunder international law principle family unity child refugee descendant also considered refugee durable solution found unrwa unhcr recognize descendant refugee basis practice widely accepted international community including donor refugee hosting country gtpalestine refugee distinct protracted refugee situation afghanistan somalia multiple generation refugee considered unhcr refugee supported protracted refugee situation result failure find political solution underlying political crisis ironically even jew viewed refugee 2000 year passing wish come back jerusalem generation generation see jew would happy told fraction u come back right fact point british tried restrict zionist immigration palestine faced jewish resistance illegal immigration palestinian aspiration understandable compensation different story could part solution palestinian refugee side want cant entire solution,central issue seems crop often israelipalestinian conflict event 1947 1948 palestinian call nakba arabic catastrophe israeli call war independence point rehash event time period rather point would better involved everyone could move event time period stop trying change past stop ignoring reality clear mean ignore forget history many lesson learned history history incredibly important culture would never expect anyone jewish forget forgive holocaust dont expect anyone palestinian thing come nakba main difference reaction affected holocaust affected nakba germany legitimacy constantly questioned result action world still fighting wwii difference two situation german long history atoning action past 75 year basic premise order peace people must able move past trauma stop fighting old fight feel wont peace israeli palestinian group able fully recognize group isnt going anywhere people today 75 year ago also feel outside actor continue perpetuate conflict denying legitimacy israel way established uncomfortable truth many country became way today similar way israel yet one question legitimacy pragmatic rather idealistic standpoint important recognize neither israeli palestinian going anywhere must continue fight fight,P,Confidence: High | The comment directly supports the Palestinian perspective by citing international law and UN/UNRWA/UNHCR recognition of Palestinian refugees and their descendants.

1979,kiagcng,1.0,"lol your entire message further proves my point that israel is never held to the same standard. before october 7th, there was not peace. of course it wasnâ€™t what it is now, but israelâ€™s hands have NEVER been clean. the IDF has committed all of the same horrible things that hamas has done, but no one even batted an eye at it because they are above the law and palestinians are looked at as less than humans. your arguement continues that sense of thinking. i suggest you do some factual and credible research on the treatment of palestinians before october 7 because your sadly mistaken. 

and no i donâ€™t think october 7 was beneficial towards ending occupation. i think it made things so much worse. but at the same time, i will never understand what itâ€™s like to live in oppression, so i can cast my judgement on what i believe is right and wrong, but i have never been in that situation and i imagine you havenâ€™t either, so our judgements are merely outside views since we are not in that position. if someone had their foot in my neck for so long, iâ€™m not sure if i would fight with words or fight back physically and thatâ€™s the choices that hamas decided to make.

itâ€™s sad that your view is only critical of palestinians violence but not israelâ€™s 75 years of violence. as i have said, i donâ€™t believe what hamas did was right, but israel isnâ€™t in the clear at all. i can admit that, but it seems like you canâ€™t admit that because you have a double standard. this conversation at this point is meaningless",IsraelPalestine,2024-01-17 15:28:24,198pp9l,pochita119,0.0,1.0,2024-01-07 00:04:45,15.0,50.0,"Aight, heading into this and have no idea what I'm getting into. I usually just lurk on Reddit but been wanting to say something on this.   
I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden which is a traditionally quite ""pro-Palestine"" city due to the considerable background of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants, as well as a history of leftist movements in Sweden in general sympathizing with the Palestinian cause under the trope of an anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist struggle. So essentially while I have my view of the conflict, it goes against the opinion of my city, school, and the social circles I hang around. And I don't say it to people irl either unless I trust them fearing they might react in a seriously negative form, hence the other reason to post it here on Reddit.   
So the Gaza war currently ongoing is atrocious, and no one who isn't sick-minded is glorifying the casualties and deaths of thousands of innocents in the Gaza strip. And this is where I have mixed feelings about said ceasefire and the whole Israel bashing. Israel didn't start this campaign because they thought it was amusing or something, similar atrocities happened on the 7th of October where almost 1200 Israelis were killed/kidnapped by Hamas militants. And this is where I see the flaws or inconsistencies of the pro-Palestine side I see, there's the condemnation of what Israel is currently doing. But at least from what I saw there was barely any condemnation of what Hamas did from said pro-Palestine crowds.   
This is kind of infuriating or bizarre to me because the excuses that I was given were either: 1.""Well the Gaza population doesn't represent Hamas"" Obviously not, but neither does the Israeli population represent the Israeli government.   
OR  


2.""Well this wouldn't have happened if Israel didn't....""   
To me is a piss poor argument, because you could rhetorically make the same argument for what Israel is doing rn i.e. ""Well this wouldn't be happening if Hamas didn't..."" etc. Or the idea that 'Extremism breeds extremism"". And by using this logic ""Well if nuh nuh didn't do nuh nuh this wouldn't have..."" Back to almost decades of the conflict. (And I get that you can't discuss this conflict without DEEP historical nuance and understanding but I'm just talking about the Gaza war in the immediate context).  
And so this is where I'm conflicted on the matter. I still maintain the position that I held for years, which is that of the two-state solution.   
But this is impossible because for almost a decade if not longer, only the radicals have had a say on these matters, and this toxicity spreads to rhetoric in the debate in the West.   
Netanyahou's far-right government is not just trampling on Palestine but also endangering Israeli democratic institutions. And then there's the lack of a unified platform for the Palestinian cause in general i.e. Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas being a terrorist organisation that vows the destruction of Israel.  
But in this current affairs, I only see extremists doing the talking and action, so I guess I form my opinion around the extremists. And if there is to be an end to the immediate ongoing conflict, then imo no matter how appalling the casualties for people in the Gaza strip are, Hamas is also responsible for this ongoing horror. And if they continue to exist then they will continue repeating these kind of attacks and Israel will again react and overreact leading to a large number of deaths.   
So the Netanyahu gov. has responsibility for the suffering of people in Gaza rn and for the backpeddling of the two-state solution for almost a decade. In the immediate term, Hamas must cease to exist for everyone's sake as they are an obvious destabilizing factor not just for Israel and Palestine. But the wholeÂ regionÂ too.

This is extremely telling. Israel is the proving ground. It's where the bullet hits the bone. God either honors the grandiose promises of glory and supremacy He supposedly made to the descendants of Ishmael, or all those promises and prophesies were a bunch of malarkey.

Before the Civil Rights Movement in the USA, American Blacks served an important if deplorable role in the minds of southern American Whites: a permanent underclass, onto which Whites could vent their frustrations without consequence. No matter how hard or unfair life was, a poor White man could (and frequently *did*) take solace in the fact that ""At least I'm not some filthy N-word."" Harassing and mistreating Blacks was a socially sanctioned form of catharsis for many unhappy and unfortunate Whites. And nothing made such Whites angrier than seeing Black people thrive, succeed, and enjoy life, because this threatened their worldview. And this is when lynchings took place. (*""Hang those uppity n*****s!""*)

Imagine an alternate timeline in which the post-Civil-War cleanup had involved the US government incorporating a large new state in the South, designated by law to be run by Blacks for Blacks. Whites who lived there already could stay, but they absolutely could not lord over the Black majority, and any attempts to do so were swiftly and effectively prosecuted. There would be at least a sizable plurality of racist Southern Whites whose righteous indignation over having to accept Blacks as equals, and be a minority amongst them, would be boundless and unquenchable. To this day, that Black state's very existence would be attacked and treated as an abomination that needed undoing, until those filthy N-words could be put in their proper place again, and all was right with the world once more. Because when your tribal pride and sense of supremacy over other tribes is all you've got going for you, oh yeah, you're going to cling to it and fight for it tenaciously.

People reading about this conflict need to understand that Jews have long played that same role of whipping boy, of denigrated and vanquished ""other"", to Muslim Arabs. Poormouthing and mistreating Jews with impunity has long been a valued outlet for catharsis among Muslim Arabs, which finds a fair degree of support in the Qur'an and Hadiths. As painful as life could be, and as cruel and capricious their own leaders could be, Muslim Arabs could, and often did, take solace in the fact that at least they weren't filthy Jews. And seeing Jews in their midst happy and thriving when times were tough for them, was enough to incite murderous rage against them (*'Idbah al-YahÅ«d!*)

Arab Muslims and their sympathizers really don't like me saying this, and will play all kinds of head games and word games with me to make me look and feel bad for saying it. Because it doesn't make them, their culture, and their religion look good in the eyes of the world. But if any lasting resolution to this conflict is possible, it needs to be said and duly understood. Because it's the truth, and it's not going away. This kind of racism, which acts as a weight-bearing pillar in the societies where it occurs, cannot be appeased away or quenched with kindness. It's the same reason why there is nothing peaceful or wholesome a victim of abuse or bullying can do to get his tormentor to treat him better. The abuse is driven by the bully's psychological need to dominate, and take out his frustrations on, someone who can't do anything about it. Anything short of a full-force, no-regret retaliation only encourages this bullying behavior further.

This is why I support Israel in this conflict, and see their relative lack of mercy in retaliating for October 7th as called for. Come what may, it behooves Israel, and the Jewish people worldwide, to show the Muslim Arab world that they are nobody's fool, nobody's whipping boy, and nobody's scapegoat for their own internal problems. The overcrowded, interconnected world that's dawning cannot afford this type of large-scale debasement of one people by another for psychological comfort. If they're to survive at all, Islam and Arab culture need to have a major reckoning, in which they learn to cope with life's pains and struggles without shifting blame onto, and attacking, a hated outside group. And that's their own problem to solve, not Israel's or tHe iNtErNaTiOnAl cOmMuNiTy's.",In this conflict: Tormentors are threatened by the loss of their tormentees.,0.81,2024-01-16 13:50:12,good theyre realistic never palestinian state restore first place meant go diddle donkey dude wouldnt wish event like ten seven worst enemy,r2ndyomkippurwar posted survey entire arab world day doha institute showed strong majority following conflict rapt attention rooting palestine feel palestinian problem problem entire arab race extremely telling israel proving ground bullet hit bone god either honor grandiose promise glory supremacy supposedly made descendant ishmael promise prophesies bunch malarkey civil right movement usa american black served important deplorable role mind southern american white permanent underclass onto white could vent frustration without consequence matter hard unfair life poor white man could frequently take solace fact least im filthy nword harassing mistreating black socially sanctioned form catharsis many unhappy unfortunate white nothing made white angrier seeing black people thrive succeed enjoy life threatened worldview lynching took place hang uppity n imagine alternate timeline postcivilwar cleanup involved u government incorporating large new state south designated law run black black white lived already could stay absolutely could lord black majority attempt swiftly effectively prosecuted would least sizable plurality racist southern white whose righteous indignation accept black equal minority amongst would boundless unquenchable day black state existence would attacked treated abomination needed undoing filthy nwords could put proper place right world tribal pride sense supremacy tribe youve got going oh yeah youre going cling fight tenaciously people reading conflict need understand jew long played role whipping boy denigrated vanquished muslim arab poormouthing mistreating jew impunity long valued outlet catharsis among muslim arab find fair degree support quran hadith painful life could cruel capricious leader could muslim arab could often take solace fact least werent filthy jew seeing jew midst happy thriving time tough enough incite murderous rage idbah alyahd arab muslim sympathizer really dont like saying play kind head game word game make look feel bad saying doesnt make culture religion look good eye world lasting resolution conflict possible need said duly understood truth going away kind racism act weightbearing pillar society occurs appeased away quenched kindness reason nothing peaceful wholesome victim abuse bullying get tormentor treat better abuse driven bully psychological need dominate take frustration someone cant anything anything short fullforce noregret retaliation encourages bullying behavior support israel conflict see relative lack mercy retaliating october 7th called come may behooves israel jewish people worldwide show muslim arab world nobody fool nobody whipping boy nobody scapegoat internal problem overcrowded interconnected world thats dawning afford type largescale debasement one people another psychological comfort theyre survive islam arab culture need major reckoning learn cope life pain struggle without shifting blame onto attacking hated outside group thats problem solve israel international community,P,"Confidence: High | The comment dismisses the idea of a Palestinian state and uses a derogatory phrase.

5187,ki7nruw,1.0,This isnt true. Itâ€™s because thereâ€™s a large period in history (1900-1948) where Arabs were the clear victims and future Israelis were the oppressors. Itâ€™s not hard to tell when Israel basically copied Belgian imperialism tactics. You can say that thereâ€™s an over-focus on this time period but at the end of the day the fact that thereâ€™s 50 whole years where one side was a clear oppressor will have some influence on the mindset of today.,IsraelPalestine,2024-01-17 01:04:52,1983bf9,BiryaniEater10,1.0,1.0,2021-07-08 17:32:05,17110.0,90.0,"r/2ndYomKippurWar posted a survey of the entire Arab world the other day by the Doha Institute, which showed that a strong majority are following this conflict with rapt attention (and rooting for Palestine), because they feel it is not just a Palestinian problem, but a problem for the entire Arab race. This is extremely telling. Israel is the proving ground. It's where the bullet hits the bone. God either honors the grandiose promises of glory and supremacy He supposedly made to the descendants of Ishmael, or all those promises and prophesies were a bunch of malarkey.

Before the Civil Rights Movement in the USA, American Blacks served an important if deplorable role in the minds of southern American Whites: a permanent underclass, onto which Whites could vent their frustrations without consequence. No matter how hard or unfair life was, a poor White man could (and frequently *did*) take solace in the fact that ""At least I'm not some filthy N-word."" Harassing and mistreating Blacks was a socially sanctioned form of catharsis for many unhappy and unfortunate Whites. And nothing made such Whites angrier than seeing Black people thrive, succeed, and enjoy life, because this threatened their worldview. And this is when lynchings took place. (*""Hang those uppity n*****s!""*)

Imagine an alternate timeline in which the post-Civil-War cleanup had involved the US government incorporating a large new state in the South, designated by law to be run by Blacks for Blacks. Whites who lived there already could stay, but they absolutely could not lord over the Black majority, and any attempts to do so were swiftly and effectively prosecuted. There would be at least a sizable plurality of racist Southern Whites whose righteous indignation over having to accept Blacks as equals, and be a minority amongst them, would be boundless and unquenchable. To this day, that Black state's very existence would be attacked and treated as an abomination that needed undoing, until those filthy N-words could be put in their proper place again, and all was right with the world once more. Because when your tribal pride and sense of supremacy over other tribes is all you've got going for you, oh yeah, you're going to cling to it and fight for it tenaciously.

People reading about this conflict need to understand that Jews have long played that same role of whipping boy, of denigrated and vanquished ""other"", to Muslim Arabs. Poormouthing and mistreating Jews with impunity has long been a valued outlet for catharsis among Muslim Arabs, which finds a fair degree of support in the Qur'an and Hadiths. As painful as life could be, and as cruel and capricious their own leaders could be, Muslim Arabs could, and often did, take solace in the fact that at least they weren't filthy Jews. And seeing Jews in their midst happy and thriving when times were tough for them, was enough to incite murderous rage against them (*'Idbah al-YahÅ«d!*)

Arab Muslims and their sympathizers really don't like me saying this, and will play all kinds of head games and word games with me to make me look and feel bad for saying it. Because it doesn't make them, their culture, and their religion look good in the eyes of the world. But if any lasting resolution to this conflict is possible, it needs to be said and duly understood. Because it's the truth, and it's not going away. This kind of racism, which acts as a weight-bearing pillar in the societies where it occurs, cannot be appeased away or quenched with kindness. It's the same reason why there is nothing peaceful or wholesome a victim of abuse or bullying can do to get his tormentor to treat him better. The abuse is driven by the bully's psychological need to dominate, and take out his frustrations on, someone who can't do anything about it. Anything short of a full-force, no-regret retaliation only encourages this bullying behavior further.

This is why I support Israel in this conflict, and see their relative lack of mercy in retaliating for October 7th as called for. Come what may, it behooves Israel, and the Jewish people worldwide, to show the Muslim Arab world that they are nobody's fool, nobody's whipping boy, and nobody's scapegoat for their own internal problems. The overcrowded, interconnected world that's dawning cannot afford this type of large-scale debasement of one people by another for psychological comfort. If they're to survive at all, Islam and Arab culture need to have a major reckoning, in which they learn to cope with life's pains and struggles without shifting blame onto, and attacking, a hated outside group. And that's their own problem to solve, not Israel's or tHe iNtErNaTiOnAl cOmMuNiTy's.",In this conflict: Tormentors are threatened by the loss of their tormentees.,0.81,2024-01-16 13:50:12,isnt true there large period history 19001948 arab clear victim future israeli oppressor hard tell israel basically copied belgian imperialism tactic say there overfocus time period end day fact there 50 whole year one side clear oppressor influence mindset today,r2ndyomkippurwar posted survey entire arab world day doha institute showed strong majority following conflict rapt attention rooting palestine feel palestinian problem problem entire arab race extremely telling israel proving ground bullet hit bone god either honor grandiose promise glory supremacy supposedly made descendant ishmael promise prophesies bunch malarkey civil right movement usa american black served important deplorable role mind southern american white permanent underclass onto white could vent frustration without consequence matter hard unfair life poor white man could frequently take solace fact least im filthy nword harassing mistreating black socially sanctioned form catharsis many unhappy unfortunate white nothing made white angrier seeing black people thrive succeed enjoy life threatened worldview lynching took place hang uppity n imagine alternate timeline postcivilwar cleanup involved u government incorporating large new state south designated law run black black white lived already could stay absolutely could lord black majority attempt swiftly effectively prosecuted would least sizable plurality racist southern white whose righteous indignation accept black equal minority amongst would boundless unquenchable day black state existence would attacked treated abomination needed undoing filthy nwords could put proper place right world tribal pride sense supremacy tribe youve got going oh yeah youre going cling fight tenaciously people reading conflict need understand jew long played role whipping boy denigrated vanquished muslim arab poormouthing mistreating jew impunity long valued outlet catharsis among muslim arab find fair degree support quran hadith painful life could cruel capricious leader could muslim arab could often take solace fact least werent filthy jew seeing jew midst happy thriving time tough enough incite murderous rage idbah alyahd arab muslim sympathizer really dont like saying play kind head game word game make look feel bad saying doesnt make culture religion look good eye world lasting resolution conflict possible need said duly understood truth going away kind racism act weightbearing pillar society occurs appeased away quenched kindness reason nothing peaceful wholesome victim abuse bullying get tormentor treat better abuse driven bully psychological need dominate take frustration someone cant anything anything short fullforce noregret retaliation encourages bullying behavior support israel conflict see relative lack mercy retaliating october 7th called come may behooves israel jewish people worldwide show muslim arab world nobody fool nobody whipping boy nobody scapegoat internal problem overcrowded interconnected world thats dawning afford type largescale debasement one people another psychological comfort theyre survive islam arab culture need major reckoning learn cope life pain struggle without shifting blame onto attacking hated outside group thats problem solve israel international community,P,"Confidence: High | The comment refutes the idea that Arab attention to the conflict is solely due to historical oppression, but then goes on to discuss a history where 'Arabs were the clear victims and future Israelis were the oppressors' and compares Israeli tactics to imperialism, clearly aligning with a pro-Palestinian perspective.",449,0.4646,0.069,0.895,0.036,positive,0.1585884353741496,0.4159863945578231,positive,0.20126031,0.06546012,0.009231567,0.17769934,0.031314444,0.043250903

He was routinely invited to [rabbinical assemblies](https://www.jta.org/2012/01/15/default/timeline-mlk-and-the-jews) and honored. His admiration for Jews and Israel most likely came from one of religious admiration, as he had supported Israel prior to the 1967 war. Jews had also shared a common enemy with MLK, as both blacks and Jews suffered severe racism at the time. Jews could pass as white, but they were still routinely excluded from mainstream events.  The KKK did not care about what you stood for, they only cared about what you looked like. He admired Israel for it's democratic values:

&gt;Peace for Israel means security, and we must stand with all of our might to protect its right to exist, its territorial integrity. I see Israel, and never mind saying it, as one of the great outposts of democracy in the world, and a marvelous example of what can be done, how desert land almost can be transformed into an oasis of brotherhood and democracy.

Keep in mind this was said in 1968, and it is remarkably similar to what your average Zionist would probably say today.

He was also one of the first to speak out against the [Soviet Union's treatment of Jews](https://www.jta.org/archive/dr-martin-luther-king-urges-moscow-to-change-policy-on-jews?_ga=2.140841202.1392765997.1705339055-875049439.1705339055) in 1965:

&gt;I should like to add my voice to the list of distinguished Americans of all faiths who have called the injustices perpetrated against the Jewish community in the Soviet Union to the attention of the world.

It was great for Black-Jewish relations at the time, but unfortunately MLK is not as mainstream anymore. Why does BLM, who sees themselves as the modern day descendants of the civil rights movement, practically ignore everything MLK said about Jews?

Because BLM is a Marxist organization, not a civil rights one and Marxists hate Israel. They are more inspired by the black power movements from the 1960s and look to figures like Malcolm X and Angela Davis, who had routinely expressed sympathies for the PLO and Soviet Union.

Malcom X in 1964, [writes](https://malcolm-x.org/docs/gen_zion.htm):

&gt;The Zionist armies that now occupy Palestine claim their ancient Jewish prophets predicted that in the ""last days of this world"" their own God would raise them up a ""messiah"" who would lead them to their promised land, and they would set up their own ""divine"" government in this newly-gained land, this ""divine"" government would enable them to ""rule all other nations with a rod of iron.""If the Israeli Zionists believe their present occupation of Arab Palestine is the fulfillment of predictions made by their Jewish prophets, then they also religiously believe that Israel must fulfill its ""divine"" mission to rule all other nations with a rod of irons, which only means a different form of iron-like rule, more firmly entrenched even, than that of the former European Colonial Powers.

Sound familiar? It's almost word for word what your average Antizionist would say today. Zionism was a religious movement, not a secular one, and Jews are colonizers and seek to rule the world.

Angela Davis, who was hardly a [civil rights hero](https://forward.com/opinion/417302/angela-davis-human-rights-activist/), was a wild fanatic of the [Soviet Union](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/10/archives/miss-davis-hails-soviets-policies-but-the-comments-on-tour-arouse.html). She had expressed sympathies for terrorists like Leila Khaled and [Rasmea Odeh](https://www.ebony.com/angela-davis-rasmea-odeh-connecting-palestine-prisons-police-495/), who are now lionized today among the anti-Israel left.

When did the shift away from MLK occur? It was most likely when blacks had gotten impatient with progress, and no longer wanted to turn the other cheek. The only way to fight back against racism was by force and to arm themselves. It was an optimal time for communism to infiltrate the civil rights movement, and to start seeing the world in terms of imperialist injustice. In the 1960s, the Black Panthers were a minority group and not as mainstream as MLK. Today, the Black Panthers represent fighting back against a police state and a government that constantly surveils minorities. The shift away from MLK also resulted in increased antisemitism in the black community.

In addition to admiration for the Soviet Union, there was just plain antisemitism as outline by [James Baldwin in 1967.](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-antisem.html) [Stokely Carmichael](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/stokely-carmichael) also exemplified the Antizionism in the Black Power movemnet. 

Today, BLM follows the same militarism and Palestinian solidarity that was present in the 1960s. Their stance on colonialism was not exactly a [secret](https://www.adl.org/resources/media-watch/adl-black-lives-matter). In 2019, Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of BLM had [stated](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/black-lives-matters-jewish-problem-in-their-own-words/):

&gt;We realized we need to take our (Palestinian) solidarity a step further. We need to be more public. And so one of the first delegations that went to Palestine was led by the Dream Defenders. It was folks from Ferguson, folks from Black Lives Matter, folks from Dream Defenders, and we went on a solidarity tripâ€¦ And \[we\] took several delegations to Palestine after that, and I think in some ways have been laying the foundation for the more public face in solidarity. And I think itâ€™s been incredibly powerful for our movement.

Even more horrifying was BLM's open support for [Hamas and 10/7](https://nypost.com/2023/10/10/blm-chicago-under-fire-for-pro-palestine-post-featuring-paragliding-terrorist/). 3 days after the worst massacre of Jews in recent history, one of the biggest BLM chapters had used the same paraglider symbolism that National SJP chapters had.  It wasn't solidarity with Jews, it was a statement intended to be against Israel's alleged settler colonialism and support for ""armed resistance"". Admiration for ""armed resistance"" like that practiced by the Black Panthers.

BLM also takes the view that Israel and the United States brutalize minorities. They point to programs such as the ADL's US-Israel police exchange, and argue that Israel teaches US police officers how to silence minority voices (the program actually teaches about crowd control and anti-terrorist tactics). The organization takes the usual view that Israel is a racist, apartheid state. Since BLM is fighting against racism, it's natural for them to criticize Israel. They attempt to apply an American race-relations framework  to Israel, and it does not fit at all. BLM overlooks the fact that Jews aren't just white, and they intentionally play into the historical revisionism surrounding Israel.

It's time that BLM return to MLK's ideas about Israel, not continue with Malcom X's. To return to MLK would be a remarkable improvement in Black-Jewish relations.",MLK and the Jews,0.72,2024-01-15 18:16:17,False,mlk friend jew routinely invited rabbinical assembly honored admiration jew israel likely came one religious admiration supported israel prior 1967 war jew also shared common enemy mlk black jew suffered severe racism time jew could pas white still routinely excluded mainstream event kkk care stood cared looked like admired israel democratic value gtpeace israel mean security must stand might protect right exist territorial integrity see israel never mind saying one great outpost democracy world marvelous example done desert land almost transformed oasis brotherhood democracy keep mind said 1968 remarkably similar average zionist would probably say today also one first speak soviet union treatment jew 1965 gti like add voice list distinguished american faith called injustice perpetrated jewish community soviet union attention world great blackjewish relation time unfortunately mlk mainstream anymore blm see modern day descendant civil right movement practically ignore everything mlk said jew blm marxist organization civil right one marxist hate israel inspired black power movement 1960s look figure like malcolm x angela davis routinely expressed sympathy plo soviet union malcom x 1964 writes gtthe zionist army occupy palestine claim ancient jewish prophet predicted last day world god would raise messiah would lead promised land would set divine government newlygained land divine government would enable rule nation rod ironif israeli zionist believe present occupation arab palestine fulfillment prediction made jewish prophet also religiously believe israel must fulfill divine mission rule nation rod iron mean different form ironlike rule firmly entrenched even former european colonial power sound familiar almost word word average antizionist would say today zionism religious movement secular one jew colonizer seek rule world angela davis hardly civil right hero wild fanatic soviet union expressed sympathy terrorist like leila khaled rasmea odeh lionized today among antiisrael left shift away mlk occur likely black gotten impatient progress longer wanted turn cheek way fight back racism force arm optimal time communism infiltrate civil right movement start seeing world term imperialist injustice 1960s black panther minority group mainstream mlk today black panther represent fighting back police state government constantly surveils minority shift away mlk also resulted increased antisemitism black community addition admiration soviet union plain antisemitism outline james baldwin 1967 stokely carmichael also exemplified antizionism black power movemnet today blm follows militarism palestinian solidarity present 1960s stance colonialism exactly secret 2019 patrisse cullors cofounder blm stated gtwe realized need take palestinian solidarity step need public one first delegation went palestine led dream defender folk ferguson folk black life matter folk dream defender went solidarity trip took several delegation palestine think way laying foundation public face solidarity think incredibly powerful movement even horrifying blms open support hamas 107 3 day worst massacre jew recent history one biggest blm chapter used paraglider symbolism national sjp chapter wasnt solidarity jew statement intended israel alleged settler colonialism support armed resistance admiration armed resistance like practiced black panther blm also take view israel united state brutalize minority point program adls usisrael police exchange argue israel teach u police officer silence minority voice program actually teach crowd control antiterrorist tactic organization take usual view israel racist apartheid state since blm fighting racism natural criticize israel attempt apply american racerelations framework israel fit blm overlook fact jew arent white intentionally play historical revisionism surrounding israel time blm return mlks idea israel continue malcom x return mlk would remarkable improvement blackjewish relation,P,"Confidence: High | The comment simply states '[False.](https://apnews.com/article/israel-detention-jails-palestinians-west-bank-793a3b2a1ce8439d08756da8c63e5435)' and provides a link to an AP article.

I'm just shocked that this hasn't been part of the discussion at all, to be honest.
  

  
The following information is pulled directly from the report.
  

  
During arrest 42% of Children were injured, including gunshot wounds and broken bones, and 65% of children were arrested during the night mostly between midnight and dawn. Half of all arrests took place in the children's homes.
  

  
The majority of children experienced appalling levels of physical and emotional abuse, including being beaten (86%), being threatened with harm (70%), and being hit with sticks or guns (60%).
  

  
Some children reported violence and abuse of a sexual nature, including being hit or touched in the genitals and 69% reported being strip searched.
  

  
60% of children experienced solidarity confinement with the length of time varying from one 1 day to as long as 48 days. 
  

  
Children were denied access to basic services, 70% said they suffered from hunger and 68% said they didn't receive any healthcare.
  

  
Once again, this report was published on the 10th of **July 2023**. It's harrowing reading these children's accounts. Children being prosecuted in military courts, and subjected to dehumanizing practices is sickening and makes my blood boil.


  
I know that during a war, people will often handwave away deeds committed by 'their side' as 'uncomfortable but necessary', but this is never the right course of action, and as long as people make excuses for those that commit heinous deeds ""We'll deal with it in the future"", ""I don't like it, but they're the enemy', then horrible people will continue to hurt others for generations to come.

You know, Hamas and Hezbollah and similar groups always declare victory over the rubble against Israel (and anyone else) when the wars end no matter if they actually lost or not. So normally, they wouldn't hesitate to do it here, but I feel like this time the amount of destruction to Gaza as a place and to Gazan lives is unlike anything we've seen in previous wars that Hamas can't just go on business as usual. Additionally, October 7 dealt a massive blow to the Palestinian cause as a whole and turned a lot of public opinion, especially in the West but in other countries as well, against the Palestinians. As someone put it, people who were pro-Palestine their whole lives became *radically* pro-Israel overnight.

Taking all of this into account, surely, Hamas feels somewhat responsible for this. Or at the very least they acknowledge that they committed a massive blunder here. I think even Nasrallah after 2006 made comments to the effect that the war that destroyed Beirut was not worth it to kidnap a couple of soldiers.

So, do you think Hamas' leaders are going to come out again and shamelessly celebrate their ""victory"" over the rubble like in all the previous wars? Is Ismail Haniyeh going to come of his residence in Qatar to declare the defeat of Israel? And more importantly, if they do that, how will Palestinians react? Will they just accept it? If I were in their place, I would not accept Hamas running Gaza anymore if I had a say in the matter.

Israel (says that it) has taken innovative steps to identify and reduce civilian casualties. They (allegedly) have been better than any war in the recent past with consideration to the population density this population is and in spite of the fact that Hamas uses human shields. Good for Israel. Iâ€™m happy to see it. 

So if they can identify peaceful people who pose no threat, surely it would be okay to let those people into Israel who have lost their homes and jobs, that abided by the evacuation orders, who have profound appreciation for the leaflets that Israel sent them out of respect for their lives, and have remained non-violent through thick and thin, right? 

Talk of a population transfer, (albeit sensical, these people have no life in Gaza, Gaza city is mostly rubble, like, thousands of people are living in tents and there is, as I understand it, little to no commercial activity happening that could occupy their time and attention) has left me a little puzzled. Sure, itâ€™d be nice if egypt took in refugees (or like the Congo or whoever), but I think Israel, in its ability to identify civilians/non-combatants/peaceful people, surely should be able to take them in. They probably have more kinship with the people of Nazareth and wadi ara than those of egypt (maybe, maybe not). Why not help them and get them back on their feet with a home and running water among Bedouins or Galileans with potential for a job and a life after Gaza in Israel, one of the worlds most economically vibrant countries despite the challenges it faces?

So Israel should do them one better and recognize their Palestinian civilian status and that they mean no harm. 

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk about how Arab Israelis left over from the nakba were the peaceful ones and thus they get to stay. If there are peaceful gazans (and Israel admits as much), then why not give them a home from the river to the sea and allow them the same freedom that bedouins in the neghev and alawites in Golan heights enjoy? 

We all hate to see the civilians of Gaza suffer (I hope). But we know that letting in terrorists into Israel poses a massive threat to the Israeli people. This is just a fact. Rapist jihadists are not allowed into Israel. But Iâ€™m hugely thankful for Israelâ€™s innovations in identifying non-combatants. Itâ€™s remarkable. No other war in history. Only 23,000 or so dead and many of them are targets. So far from a genocide and Israel has made great strides to prevent that from happening out of compassion and empathy. 

But I think, Israel-willing, if Israel were to let these peaceful refugees be citizens of Israel and live like the Israeli Arabs, it would go so far and make the people happy (or at who could be made happy. There are some that may never be happy without the morbidly quixotic fantasy of destroying Israel). I think giving the people who truly mean â€œfrom the river to seaâ€ as a mode of their own personal freedom rather than a call for genocide . 

And look, I do understand that people say â€œpalestine will be Arabâ€ and that should be alarming, but I think a lot of people mean it in good faith, and Israel knows who these people are, or at least the potential candidates, because israel has taken great steps to show the deserving mercy in Gaza. 

Iâ€™d hope that Israel could salvage and save the good souls out there that mean the world no harm.

But that leads me to the so-called â€œdemographic problemâ€. Are we really afraid of the people and their children who are peaceful coming out of this war? We werenâ€™t in 1949. So Im not sure what the issue is. Even if it is 50-50 Arab and Jewish, it would be no issue if the new arab Israelis were peaceful, right? 20% Arab Israelis in Israel currently or so. Theyâ€™re grateful. They do not wish to move back to the West Bank to be with their fellow Palestinians in less than ideal circumstances. This has been a question before. But no. Theyâ€™d prefer not to live as the West Bank Arabs live, they prefer to live like the Israelis do.

Im sure there is at least a fraction of gazan civilians that would accept Israeli citizenship with gratitude, no?

1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from â€œforeignâ€ ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.
3) The residents of todays Israel are born and raised there mostly, their grandparents/great grand parents came from Europe and other Jewish diasporas (africa, syria etc), and their closest ancestors have been living there for 70+ years. Iâ€™m from Hungary (not jewish btw, jusr a regular Hungarian person), but looking at my family tree, I have ancestors from Croatia, Germany, Netherlands etc, I would be quite upset if Anyone told me to â€œgo back to Croatia where you came fromâ€.

A central issue that seems to crop up very often in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the events of 1947 and 1948. Palestinians call it the Nakba (Arabic for catastrophe), while Israelis call it the war of independence. 

My point here is not to rehash the events of that time period, but rather to point out that it would be better for all involved if everyone could move on from the events of that time period (stop trying to change the past and stop ignoring reality). 

To be clear, this does not mean we should ignore or forget history. There are many lessons to be learned from history, and history is incredibly important to all cultures. Just as I would never expect anyone who is Jewish to forget or forgive the Holocaust, I donâ€™t expect anyone who is Palestinian to do those same things when it comes to the Nakba. 

The main difference between the reactions of those affected by the Holocaust and those affected by the Nakba are that Germany does not have their legitimacy constantly questioned as a result of their actions. The world is not still fighting WWII. While there is a difference between those two situations as the Germans have a long history of atoning for their actions over the past 75 years, the basic premise is the same. In order to have peace people must be able to move on from past trauma and stop fighting the same old fight.

I just feel that there wonâ€™t be peace between Israelis and Palestinians until both groups are able to fully recognize that the other group isnâ€™t going anywhere, and that the people of today are not the same as 75 years ago. I also feel that outside actors continue to perpetuate the conflict by denying the legitimacy of Israel because of the way it was established. The uncomfortable truth is that many other countries became the way they are today in similar ways to Israel, yet no one questions their legitimacy. 

From a pragmatic rather than idealistic standpoint, it is important to recognize that neither the Israelis or Palestinians are going anywhere.

The gas lighting to deflect is not only sad and pathetic, but it's dangerous. There are so many vulnerable people confused and being fed misinformation. This is my attempt at clearing up any confusion.

1. Palestine is an apartheid state. FALSE. The IDF actually LEFT occupation of Gaza in 2005 (corrected) because they were not getting anywhere with helping establish a lawful and structured situation. It makes more sense for them to want a peaceful relationship than to cause oppression because, quite frankly, they don't want the headache. They would have stayed in Gaza if they were hell bent on apartheid (see 2 sources below in the comments section). Further, they were increasing the amount of Palestinians they allowed into Israel to work because there was no economy in Palestine. Occupation to ensure safety is not the same as total control to the point that citizens cannot democratically cast their votes in elections, and total dehumanization of a race, for which South African Apartheid was coined. Mexicans have as much trouble on the boarder of the US as do Palestinians. Thatâ€™s boarder control. 
2. The IDF is committing Genocide. FALSE. They bombed to gain control of Gaza. Hamas on the other hand has Genocide as their intent for all Jews written in their Covenant. What is this ""cease fire?"" They are still there because they need to ensure the safety of the Israeli people. 

The living conditions of Palestinians were of developing world conditions before this war due to Iranian funded MILLIONS going only to funding weapons and for the creation of an intricate tunnel system with the intent to attack Israel. Israel can only do so much with neighbors who are hell bent on their destruction. Israel is the one with the Iron Dome, not Palestine. Stop gaslighting that Palestinians are the only innocent victims. Where is your same outrage for Oct 7th ? Why have you not condemned Hamas ? No one is as worried or concerned of racial cleansing of Jews. 

The fact of the matter is, Hamas and Iran, and other Arab countries who are not open to Westernization, are hell bent on the ELIMINATION of Israel, to control the Middle East and kill the Jews. There is your ""genocide."" Stop spinning the narrative after Israel defends itself. It's just too bad that people don't like Jews and absolutely refuse to accept Israel as a country, because Israel isn't going anywhere.

This is extremely telling. Israel is the proving ground. It's where the bullet hits the bone. God either honors the grandiose promises of glory and supremacy He supposedly made to the descendants of Ishmael, or all those promises and prophesies were a bunch of malarkey.

Before the Civil Rights Movement in the USA, American Blacks served an important if deplorable role in the minds of southern American Whites: a permanent underclass, onto which Whites could vent their frustrations without consequence. No matter how hard or unfair life was, a poor White man could (and frequently *did*) take solace in the fact that ""At least I'm not some filthy N-word."" Harassing and mistreating Blacks was a socially sanctioned form of catharsis for many unhappy and unfortunate Whites. And nothing made such Whites angrier than seeing Black people thrive, succeed, and enjoy life, because this threatened their worldview. And this is when lynchings took place. (*""Hang those uppity n*****s!""*)

Imagine an alternate timeline in which the post-Civil-War cleanup had involved the US government incorporating a large new state in the South, designated by law to be run by Blacks for Blacks. Whites who lived there already could stay, but they absolutely could not lord over the Black majority, and any attempts to do so were swiftly and effectively prosecuted. There would be at least a sizable plurality of racist Southern Whites whose righteous indignation over having to accept Blacks as equals, and be a minority amongst them, would be boundless and unquenchable. To this day, that Black state's very existence would be attacked and treated as an abomination that needed undoing, until those filthy N-words could be put in their proper place again, and all was right with the world once more. Because when your tribal pride and sense of supremacy over other tribes is all you've got going for you, oh yeah, you're going to cling to it and fight for it tenaciously.

People reading about this conflict need to understand that Jews have long played that same role of whipping boy, of denigrated and vanquished ""other"", to Muslim Arabs. Poormouthing and mistreating Jews with impunity has long been a valued outlet for catharsis among Muslim Arabs, which finds a fair degree of support in the Qur'an and Hadiths. As painful as life could be, and as cruel and capricious their own leaders could be, Muslim Arabs could, and often did, take solace in the fact that at least they weren't filthy Jews. And seeing Jews in their midst happy and thriving when times were tough for them, was enough to incite murderous rage against them (*'Idbah al-YahÅ«d!*)

Arab Muslims and their sympathizers really don't like me saying this, and will play all kinds of head games and word games with me to make me look and feel bad for saying it. Because it doesn't make them, their culture, and their religion look good in the eyes of the world. But if any lasting resolution to this conflict is possible, it needs to be said and duly understood. Because it's the truth, and it's not going away. This kind of racism, which acts as a weight-bearing pillar in the societies where it occurs, cannot be appeased away or quenched with kindness. It's the same reason why there is nothing peaceful or wholesome a victim of abuse or bullying can do to get his tormentor to treat him better. The abuse is driven by the bully's psychological need to dominate, and take out his frustrations on, someone who can't do anything about it. Anything short of a full-force, no-regret retaliation only encourages this bullying behavior further.

This is why I support Israel in this conflict, and see their relative lack of mercy in retaliating for October 7th as called for. Come what may, it behooves Israel, and the Jewish people worldwide, to show the Muslim Arab world that they are nobody's fool, nobody's whipping boy, and nobody's scapegoat for their own internal problems.

When I ask people why, I get answers ranging from 'its complicated', 'Israel are oppressors' to 'Palestinians are terrorists'.

But none of these explain why the conflict has persisted for so long. I believe the reason is because several actors want it to continue. It has been designed to never end, it is manufactured to continue. If the conflict is solved, then the Jewish state gains more legitimacy and becomes significantly more difficult to dismantle.

In Islam, the place of the Jew is below that of the Muslim. They are meant to be second-class citizens, defenseless, stateless and subject to additional taxes. Their place is certainly not to be ruling over Islamic land, and certainly not ruling over Muslims.

In 1948 the Jews accepted a partition plan and declared independence, in their charter they invited the Arabs inside the borders to accept full citizenship and rights and join in the nation building exercise. Arab leaders rejected this and went to war. The war produced 700k Palestinian refugees, a tragic event that caused untold pain and trauma to these people, but they are not unique, the same year similar events happened in Pakistan/India and all across the middle east.

If this conflict was about people losing their homes, it would be solved already. Throughout the 20th century many peoples have lost their homes (jews more than anyone), they move on, they resettle and they build a future for their children, the conflict would be solved by now if this was the issue.

If this conflict was about occupation, or settlements then there would have been no war in 1967. Pre 1967, Israel existed inside her borders with no occupation and no settlements. Everyone had citizenship and equal voting rights.

If this conflict was simply about land, then they would have solved it by now, there has been several solutions on the table to share the land, in 1937 the partition plan recommended a very small Jewish state, and the vast majority of the land would have went to the Arabs. The Arabs rejected this, because any sort of a Jewish state was unacceptable.

After the displacement of the Palestinians during the 48 war. Arab states refused to give citizenship to Palestinians because they know if the Palestinians get resettled then the conflict ends, Jordan actually made this mistake in 48, they invaded and annexed the west bank and gave everyone citizenship. They later withdrew it because they knew this was not compatible with a persistent conflict. Eygpt invaded and controlled Gaza in 48, there was no citizenship granted to the Palestinians. There was certainly no talk between Eygpt and Jordan at the time about establishing a Palestinian state. That would of course have ended the conflict. 

All refugees the world over are handled by UNHCR and they get resettled and move on, the Palestinians however are the only refugees handled by UNWRA who do not have a policy of resettling and actually pass the refugee status on to the children of the Palestinians even if they live in a far away land. For example Bella Hadid qualifies as a Palestinians refugee.

The conflict has persisted because the Jewish state has persisted. Its an opposition to the existence of one. If it was for any other reason then the conflict would be solved by now, one of the many peace deals would have been accepted.

This conflict is manufactured, created, encouraged and it will not end as long as the Arabs refuse to accept a Jewish state, BTW, accepting one on paper does not mean they accept it in reality. Eygpt has signed peace deals with Israel, the general public do not accept the 'Zionist entity'.",The reason the Israel/Palestinian conflict persists,0.77,2024-01-16 08:28:54,arab state participated war israel refused settle palestinian land forced stay refugee status additionally unwra policy exacerbating issue unwatch exposed much bullshit,conflict unique fact persisted long without solution ask people get answer ranging complicated israel oppressor palestinian terrorist none explain conflict persisted long believe reason several actor want continue designed never end manufactured continue conflict solved jewish state gain legitimacy becomes significantly difficult dismantle islam place jew muslim meant secondclass citizen defenseless stateless subject additional tax place certainly ruling islamic land certainly ruling muslim 1948 jew accepted partition plan declared independence charter invited arab inside border accept full citizenship right join nation building exercise arab leader rejected went war war produced 700k palestinian refugee tragic event caused untold pain trauma people unique year similar event happened pakistanindia across middle east conflict people losing home would solved already throughout 20th century many people lost home jew anyone move resettle build future child conflict would solved issue conflict occupation settlement would war 1967 pre 1967 israel existed inside border occupation settlement everyone citizenship equal voting right conflict simply land would solved several solution table share land 1937 partition plan recommended small jewish state vast majority land would went arab arab rejected sort jewish state unacceptable displacement palestinian 48 war arab state refused give citizenship palestinian know palestinian get resettled conflict end jordan actually made mistake 48 invaded annexed west bank gave everyone citizenship later withdrew knew compatible persistent conflict eygpt invaded controlled gaza 48 citizenship granted palestinian certainly talk eygpt jordan time establishing palestinian state would course ended conflict refugee world handled unhcr get resettled move palestinian however refugee handled unwra policy resettling actually pas refugee status child palestinian even live far away land example bella hadid qualifies palestinian refugee conflict persisted jewish state persisted opposition existence one reason conflict would solved one many peace deal would accepted conflict manufactured created encouraged end long arab refuse accept jewish state btw accepting one paper mean accept reality eygpt signed peace deal israel general public accept zionist entity,P,"Confidence: Medium | The comment criticizes Arab states for not settling Palestinians and blames UNWRA for exacerbating the issue, aligning with a narrative that places blame on external actors for the continuation of the conflict, which indirectly supports Palestinian grievances about their refugee status and living conditions.",276,-0.9213,0.0,0.743,0.257,negative,-0.05,0.2,neutral,0.7701451,0.70864636,0.2322566,0.41222036,0.030278467,0.47384647

I usually just lurk on Reddit but been wanting to say something on this.   
I live in MalmÃ¶, Sweden which is a traditionally quite ""pro-Palestine"" city due to the considerable background of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants, as well as a history of leftist movements in Sweden in general sympathizing with the Palestinian cause under the trope of an anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist struggle. So essentially while I have my view of the conflict, it goes against the opinion of my city, school, and the social circles I hang around. And I don't say it to people irl either unless I trust them fearing they might react in a seriously negative form, hence the other reason to post it here on Reddit.   
So the Gaza war currently ongoing is atrocious, and no one who isn't sick-minded is glorifying the casualties and deaths of thousands of innocents in the Gaza strip. And this is where I have mixed feelings about said ceasefire and the whole Israel bashing. Israel didn't start this campaign because they thought it was amusing or something, similar atrocities happened on the 7th of October where almost 1200 Israelis were killed/kidnapped by Hamas militants. And this is where I see the flaws or inconsistencies of the pro-Palestine side I see, there's the condemnation of what Israel is currently doing. But at least from what I saw there was barely any condemnation of what Hamas did from said pro-Palestine crowds.   
This is kind of infuriating or bizarre to me because the excuses that I was given were either: 1.""Well the Gaza population doesn't represent Hamas"" Obviously not, but neither does the Israeli population represent the Israeli government.

2.""Well this wouldn't have happened if Israel didn't....""   
To me is a piss poor argument, because you could rhetorically make the same argument for what Israel is doing rn i.e. ""Well this wouldn't be happening if Hamas didn't..."" etc. Or the idea that 'Extremism breeds extremism"". And by using this logic ""Well if nuh nuh didn't do nuh nuh this wouldn't have..."" Back to almost decades of the conflict.

And so this is where I'm conflicted on the matter. I still maintain the position that I held for years, which is that of the two-state solution.   
But this is impossible because for almost a decade if not longer, only the radicals have had a say on these matters, and this toxicity spreads to rhetoric in the debate in the West.   
Netanyahou's far-right government is not just trampling on Palestine but also endangering Israeli democratic institutions. And then there's the lack of a unified platform for the Palestinian cause in general i.e. Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas being a terrorist organisation that vows the destruction of Israel.  
But in this current affairs, I only see extremists doing the talking and action, so I guess I form my opinion around the extremists. And if there is to be an end to the immediate ongoing conflict, then imo no matter how appalling the casualties for people in the Gaza strip are, Hamas is also responsible for this ongoing horror. And if they continue to exist then they will continue repeating these kind of attacks and Israel will again react and overreact leading to a large number of deaths.   
So the Netanyahu gov. has responsibility for the suffering of people in Gaza rn and for the backpeddling of the two-state solution for almost a decade.

This is extremely telling. Israel is the proving ground. It's where the bullet hits the bone. God either honors the grandiose promises of glory and supremacy He supposedly made to the descendants of Ishmael, or all those promises and prophesies were a bunch of malarkey.

Before the Civil Rights Movement in the USA, American Blacks served an important if deplorable role in the minds of southern American Whites: a permanent underclass, onto which Whites could vent their frustrations without consequence. No matter how hard or unfair life was, a poor White man could (and frequently *did*) take solace in the fact that ""At least I'm not some filthy N-word."" Harassing and mistreating Blacks was a socially sanctioned form of catharsis for many unhappy and unfortunate Whites. And nothing made such Whites angrier than seeing Black people thrive, succeed, and enjoy life, because this threatened their worldview. And this is when lynchings took place. (*""Hang those uppity n*****s!""*)

Imagine an alternate timeline in which the post-Civil-War cleanup had involved the US government incorporating a large new state in the South, designated by law to be run by Blacks for Blacks. Whites who lived there already could stay, but they absolutely could not lord over the Black majority, and any attempts to do so were swiftly and effectively prosecuted. There would be at least a sizable plurality of racist Southern Whites whose righteous indignation over having to accept Blacks as equals, and be a minority amongst them, would be boundless and unquenchable. To this day, that Black state's very existence would be attacked and treated as an abomination that needed undoing, until those filthy N-words could be put in their proper place again, and all was right with the world once more. Because when your tribal pride and sense of supremacy over other tribes is all you've got going for you, oh yeah, you're going to cling to it and fight for it tenaciously.

People reading about this conflict need to understand that Jews have long played that same role of whipping boy, of denigrated and vanquished ""other"", to Muslim Arabs. Poormouthing and mistreating Jews with impunity has long been a valued outlet for catharsis among Muslim Arabs, which finds a fair degree of support in the Qur'an and Hadiths. As painful as life could be, and as cruel and capricious their own leaders could be, Muslim Arabs could, and often did, take solace in the fact that at least they weren't filthy Jews. And seeing Jews in their midst happy and thriving when times were tough for them, was enough to incite murderous rage against them (*'Idbah al-YahÅ«d!*)

Arab Muslims and their sympathizers really don't like me saying this, and will play all kinds of head games and word games with me to make me look and feel bad for saying it. Because it doesn't make them, their culture, and their religion look good in the eyes of the world. But if any lasting resolution to this conflict is possible, it needs to be said and duly understood. Because it's the truth, and it's not going away. This kind of racism, which acts as a weight-bearing pillar in the societies where it occurs, cannot be appeased away or quenched with kindness. It's the same reason why there is nothing peaceful or wholesome a victim of abuse or bullying can do to get his tormentor to treat him better. The abuse is driven by the bully's psychological need to dominate, and take out his frustrations on, someone who can't do anything about it. Anything short of a full-force, no-regret retaliation only encourages this bullying behavior further.

This is why I support Israel in this conflict, and see their relative lack of mercy in retaliating for October 7th as called for. Come what may, it behooves Israel, and the Jewish people worldwide, to show the Muslim Arab world that they are nobody's fool, nobody's whipping boy, and nobody's scapegoat for their own internal problems. The overcrowded, interconnected world that's dawning cannot afford this type of large-scale debasement of one people by another for psychological comfort. If they're to survive at all, Islam and Arab culture need to have a major reckoning, in which they learn to cope with life's pains and struggles without shifting blame onto, and attacking, a hated outside group. And that's their own problem to solve, not Israel's or tHe iNtErNaTiOnAl cOmMuNiTy's.",In this conflict: Tormentors are threatened by the loss of their tormentees.,0.81,2024-01-16 13:50:12,yet wish genocide palestinian sure dude,r2ndyomkippurwar posted survey entire arab world day doha institute showed strong majority following conflict rapt attention rooting palestine feel palestinian problem problem entire arab race extremely telling israel proving ground bullet hit bone god either honor grandiose promise glory supremacy supposedly made descendant ishmael promise prophesies bunch malarkey civil right movement usa american black served important deplorable role mind southern american white permanent underclass onto white could vent frustration without consequence matter hard unfair life poor white man could frequently take solace fact least im filthy nword harassing mistreating black socially sanctioned form catharsis many unhappy unfortunate white nothing made white angrier seeing black people thrive succeed enjoy life threatened worldview lynching took place hang uppity n imagine alternate timeline postcivilwar cleanup involved u government incorporating large new state south designated law run black black white lived already could stay absolutely could lord black majority attempt swiftly effectively prosecuted would least sizable plurality racist southern white whose righteous indignation accept black equal minority amongst would boundless unquenchable day black state existence would attacked treated abomination needed undoing filthy nwords could put proper place right world tribal pride sense supremacy tribe youve got going oh yeah youre going cling fight tenaciously people reading conflict need understand jew long played role whipping boy denigrated vanquished muslim arab poormouthing mistreating jew impunity long valued outlet catharsis among muslim arab find fair degree support quran hadith painful life could cruel capricious leader could muslim arab could often take solace fact least werent filthy jew seeing jew midst happy thriving time tough enough incite murderous rage idbah alyahd arab muslim sympathizer really dont like saying play kind head game word game make look feel bad saying doesnt make culture religion look good eye world lasting resolution conflict possible need said duly understood truth going away kind racism act weightbearing pillar society occurs appeased away quenched kindness reason nothing peaceful wholesome victim abuse bullying get tormentor treat better abuse driven bully psychological need dominate take frustration someone cant anything anything short fullforce noregret retaliation encourages bullying behavior support israel conflict see relative lack mercy retaliating october 7th called come may behooves israel jewish people worldwide show muslim arab world nobody fool nobody whipping boy nobody scapegoat internal problem overcrowded interconnected world thats dawning afford type largescale debasement one people another psychological comfort theyre survive islam arab culture need major reckoning learn cope life pain struggle without shifting blame onto attacking hated outside group thats problem solve israel international community,P,"Confidence: High | The comment directly refutes the premise of the post (which implies Israel is the victim) by stating 'Yet wishes genocide of Palestinians.'

When I ask people why, I get answers ranging from 'its complicated', 'Israel are oppressors' to 'Palestinians are terrorists'.

But none of these explain why the conflict has persisted for so long. I believe the reason is because several actors want it to continue. It has been designed to never end, it is manufactured to continue. If the conflict is solved, then the Jewish state gains more legitimacy and becomes significantly more difficult to dismantle.

In Islam, the place of the Jew is below that of the Muslim. They are meant to be second-class citizens, defenseless, stateless and subject to additional taxes. Their place is certainly not to be ruling over Islamic land, and certainly not ruling over Muslims.

In 1948 the Jews accepted a partition plan and declared independence, in their charter they invited the Arabs inside the borders to accept full citizenship and rights and join in the nation building exercise. Arab leaders rejected this and went to war. The war produced 700k Palestinian refugees, a tragic event that caused untold pain and trauma to these people, but they are not unique, the same year similar events happened in Pakistan/India and all across the middle east.

If this conflict was about people losing their homes, it would be solved already. Throughout the 20th century many peoples have lost their homes (jews more than anyone), they move on, they resettle and they build a future for their children, the conflict would be solved by now if this was the issue.

If this conflict was about occupation, or settlements then there would have been no war in 1967. Pre 1967, Israel existed inside her borders with no occupation and no settlements. Everyone had citizenship and equal voting rights.

If this conflict was simply about land, then they would have solved it by now, there has been several solutions on the table to share the land, in 1937 the partition plan recommended a very small Jewish state, and the vast majority of the land would have went to the Arabs. The Arabs rejected this, because any sort of a Jewish state was unacceptable.

After the displacement of the Palestinians during the 48 war. Arab states refused to give citizenship to Palestinians because they know if the Palestinians get resettled then the conflict ends, Jordan actually made this mistake in 48, they invaded and annexed the west bank and gave everyone citizenship. They later withdrew it because they knew this was not compatible with a persistent conflict. Eygpt invaded and controlled Gaza in 48, there was no citizenship granted to the Palestinians. There was certainly no talk between Eygpt and Jordan at the time about establishing a Palestinian state. That would of course have ended the conflict. 

All refugees the world over are handled by UNHCR and they get resettled and move on, the Palestinians however are the only refugees handled by UNWRA who do not have a policy of resettling and actually pass the refugee status on to the children of the Palestinians even if they live in a far away land. For example Bella Hadid qualifies as a Palestinians refugee.

The conflict has persisted because the Jewish state has persisted. Its an opposition to the existence of one. If it was for any other reason then the conflict would be solved by now, one of the many peace deals would have been accepted.

This is a video made by YouTube creator Johnny Harris explaining the divide-and-conqueror strategy used by the Israeli far right to derail any prospect of a Palestinian state. He shows documents and even a recording of Netanyahu explaining his strategy to keep expanding into the West Bank. Netanyahu and the Israeli far right had been dead set on derailing peace going all the way back to the Oslo Accords fanning the flames of hate that led to Yitzhak Rabin's assassination.

Going back to the election of Hamas he points out how many within the Israeli government were actually to see Hamas put in power because it gave them the ability to divide the Palestinian movement and that they can treat Gaza like a hostile country. It also gives the Israeli people a boogie man to be afraid of to sabotage any appetite for peace hence why the government covertly supported them. While supporting this violent status quo the Israeli far right could keep carving up the West Bank and slowly annexing the territory while making the lives of Palestinian people unbearable. For a while, this status quo or ""One State Reality"" seemed to work, until October 7th.

- The Palestinians are mostly new Muslims who came from other countries in the last two hundred years.

-- 640 to 1099 CE: Arab Muslim occupation of the land The land was ruled by different Muslim groups for about 400 years, until it was taken by the Crusaders in 1099 CE.

- The Jews were a native ethnic minority of the country, whose size changed according to economic and political factors.

- The Jews mostly lived in big cities and some villages in the east of Galilee. There were some Jews who never left their villages and were called underground.
- The Jewish continuity is important, since it contradicts studies that present Zionism as European colonialism.

- 525,000 Muslims: population of Muslims in 1914

- 50%: percentage of them are new immigrants from Arab and Islamic countries

- 150,000 to 200,000: Jewish population before Arab-Muslim occupation 
 
- About 10 jewish villages: number of villages that remained in Israel after Arab-Muslim occupation

- 90,000 Jews: Jewish population at end of First World War

- The Mandate government inherited a population of immigrants and their descendants who arrived in Israel at the end of Ottoman rule. About 50% of them were new immigrants, Arabs and Muslims

- The Muslim population in Palestine grew from 515,000 in 1919 to about 1,200,000 in 1947. However, the Mandate government underestimated the number of illegal immigrants for political reasons.

- The legal and illegal Arab/Muslim immigration contributed to at least one-third of the real number of Muslims in the Mandate period ( 30% from 1,200,000 â€“  360,000).

- A significant part of the Palestinians were migrant workers and/or their descendants.

- The Mandate government did not allocate resources fairly for the development of the land. It focused more on the Arab sector, especially the Muslim ones.

- The official reason was that the Arabs were the native people of the land and needed help. The real reason was that the Arabs had to be kept satisfied, so they would not cause trouble in politics.

- The administration initiated most of the activities and investments in the Arab sector, while the Jewish sector only received little help only after pressure and demands from the Zionist leadership.

- The Mandate government ignored illegal Arab immigration from Syria, Lebanon, and Transjordan, and allowed free entry through Egypt and Jordan
And made laws against Jewish immigration to  Palestine(×""×™)

You know, Hamas and Hezbollah and similar groups always declare victory over the rubble against Israel (and anyone else) when the wars end no matter if they actually lost or not. So normally, they wouldn't hesitate to do it here, but I feel like this time the amount of destruction to Gaza as a place and to Gazan lives is unlike anything we've seen in previous wars that Hamas can't just go on business as usual. Additionally, October 7 dealt a massive blow to the Palestinian cause as a whole and turned a lot of public opinion, especially in the West but in other countries as well, against the Palestinians. As someone put it, people who were pro-Palestine their whole lives became *radically* pro-Israel overnight.

Taking all of this into account, surely, Hamas feels somewhat responsible for this. Or at the very least they acknowledge that they committed a massive blunder here. I think even Nasrallah after 2006 made comments to the effect that the war that destroyed Beirut was not worth it to kidnap a couple of soldiers.

So, do you think Hamas' leaders are going to come out again and shamelessly celebrate their ""victory"" over the rubble like in all the previous wars? Is Ismail Haniyeh going to come of his residence in Qatar to declare the defeat of Israel? And more importantly, if they do that, how will Palestinians react? Will they just accept it? If I were in their place, I would not accept Hamas running Gaza anymore if I had a say in the matter.

That last issue is worrying me because from what I see on other online communities, support for Hamas, or the ""resistance"", has gone up over the course of this war.
